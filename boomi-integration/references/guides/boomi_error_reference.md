## Issue #1: Message/Notify Quote Escaping

**Frequency:** Very High (Most common issue in Boomi development)
**Detection:** Silent failure - produces literal output instead of variable substitution

### The Problem

Message and Notify steps fail to substitute variables, outputting literal `{1}` instead of actual values. No errors are thrown - output is just wrong.

### Why It Happens

Single quotes toggle between literal mode and variable substitution. Inside single quotes, variables are literal text. GUI auto-escapes; programmatic generation doesn't.

### Wrong Patterns - Variables Appear Literally

```xml
<!-- Pattern 1: Full JSON wrapped in quotes, variables remain in literal mode -->
<msgTxt>'{
  "status": "{1}",
  "result": "{2}",
  "data": {3}
}'</msgTxt>
<!-- OUTPUT: {"status": "{1}", "result": "{2}", "data": {3}} ← Variables NOT substituted! -->
```

### Correct Patterns - Variables Get Substituted

```xml
<!-- Pattern 1: Toggle quotes around each variable -->
<msgTxt>'{
  "status": "'{1}'",
  "result": "'{2}'",
  "data": '{3}'
}'</msgTxt>
<!-- OUTPUT: {"status": "success", "result": "completed", "data": {...}} ← Variables substituted! -->

<!-- Pattern 2: XML doesn't depend on {} so requires no toggling -->
<msgTxt><?xml version="1.0"?>
<customer>
  <email>{1}</email>
</customer></msgTxt>
<!-- OUTPUT: <?xml version="1.0"?><customer><email>test@email.com</email></customer> ← Variables substituted! -->

<!-- Pattern 3: No quotes for simple substitution -->
<msgTxt>Processing order {1} for {2}</msgTxt>
<!-- OUTPUT: Processing order 12345 for ABC Corp ← Variables substituted! -->
```

### Quote Toggle Mechanics

- **Default mode**: Variables like `{1}` get substituted
- **Single quote enters literal mode**: No substitution until next quote
- **Single quote exits literal mode**: Back to variable substitution
- **Literal single quote**: Use two single quotes (`''`) to output one quote
- **Critical Pattern**: `'literal text '{variable}' more literal '{variable2}' end'`
- **Bare `{}` fails at execution** (push and deploy succeed): `can't parse argument number: ; Caused by: For input string: ""`. Output a literal `{}` with `<msgTxt>'{}'</msgTxt>`.

### Copy-Paste Templates (Working Patterns)

**JSON API Response:**
```xml
<msgTxt>'{
  "id": "'{1}'",
  "status": "'{2}'",
  "timestamp": "'{3}'",
  "data": '{4}'
}'</msgTxt>
```

**JSON Error Response:**
```xml
<msgTxt>'{
  "error": "'{1}'",
  "message": "'{2}'",
  "timestamp": "'{3}'"
}'</msgTxt>
```

**XML Output:**
```xml
<msgTxt><order>
  <id>{1}</id>
  <status>{2}</status>
  <customer>{3}</customer>
</order></msgTxt>
```

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing Message/Notify steps: Scan for `"{1}"` inside single quotes → Verify quote toggles `"'{1}'"` 

### Affected Steps

- Message steps (`shapetype="message"`)
- Notify steps (`shapetype="notify"`)
- Set Properties (different syntax)
- Map steps (different templating system)

## Issue #2: Environment Variables in Component XML

**Frequency:** High
**Detection:** Silent - API authentication failures with no design-time warnings

### The Problem

Environment variable references like `${APPLICATION_API_KEY}` are stored literally in component XML, causing API calls to fail with authentication errors despite appearing correctly configured.

### Why It Happens

**Project tools DO NOT currently perform variable substitution on XML files** - they read and send component XML as-is to the Boomi platform. The Boomi platform has no access to your local environment variables.

### Wrong Pattern - Causes Silent API Authentication Failures

```xml
<staticparameter staticproperty="${APPLICATION_API_KEY}"/>
```
**RESULT**: Platform stores the literal string `${APPLICATION_API_KEY}` → API calls fail with authentication errors → No design-time warnings

### Correct Pattern - Working API Authentication

```xml
<staticparameter staticproperty="demo-sk-abc123..."/>
```
**RESULT**: Platform executes with actual credential value → API calls succeed

### Critical Rule: No Variable References in XML Components

- **XML Component Files**: Must not contain `${ENV_VAR}` or other variable references — Boomi has no access to local environment variables
- `{ComponentName}` → **Local XML ONLY** (resolved by agent orchestration during creation)

### Connection Workflow

See `BOOMI_THINKING.md` § Connection Discovery and `cli_tool_reference.md` § Credential Management for the full connection resolution and credential handling workflows.

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing ANY component with credentials:
1. Search for `${...}` patterns in connection/operation XML files — remove any variable references
2. Verify `type="password"` fields are not populated with real credentials
3. Never commit real credentials to version control

---

## Issue #3: Parent-Subprocess Deployment Dependency

**Frequency:** High (Most blocking deployment issue)
**Detection:** Silent - old behavior persists despite updates

### The Problem

Parent processes snapshot subprocess versions at deployment time. Updating/deploying a subprocess does NOT automatically update parent processes that reference it.

Does not apply to Process Route subprocesses — see `references/steps/process_route_step.md`.

**Real-World Symptoms:**
- HTTP endpoints return old responses despite subprocess changes
- Process Call steps execute outdated logic
- Platform test tool shows new subprocess behavior, but WSS wrapper shows old behavior
- Multiple "fixes" that don't seem to work (because parent wasn't redeployed)

### Why It Happens

Deploy parent → Runtime captures subprocess v1 → Update subprocess → v2 deployed → Parent still executes v1 (silent failure). Parent deployment creates snapshot; runtime doesn't auto-update dependencies.

### Wrong Pattern - Subprocess Updates Ignored

```bash
# 1. Update subprocess
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh subprocess.xml
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh subprocess.xml

# 2. Test parent process
curl -X POST "${SERVER_BASE_URL}/ws/simple/endpoint"
# ← Still executes OLD subprocess version!
```

### Correct Pattern - Parent Picks Up Subprocess Changes

```bash
# 1. Update subprocess
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh subprocess.xml
# Subprocess does not need to be deployed independently

# 2. CRITICAL: Redeploy parent to pick up subprocess changes
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh parent-wrapper.xml

# 3. Wait for propagation (10-15 seconds)
sleep 15

# 4. Now test - parent will use updated subprocess
curl -X POST "${SERVER_BASE_URL}/ws/simple/endpoint"
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

When updating subprocesses:
1. Push subprocess updates to platform
2. **Repackage and redeploy parent** (required to pick up subprocess changes)
3. Wait 10-15s for propagation
4. Test parent process

**Applies to ALL component references**: Process Call steps, Map components, Profile references.

**Exception — Standalone subprocess testing**: When testing a subprocess in isolation via `boomi-test-execute.sh` (not through its parent), you must deploy the subprocess independently. The parent deploy rule above applies when testing through the parent; standalone execution requires its own deployment to pick up latest pushes.

## Issue #4: Connector Parameters Override Document Content

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Silent - document content reaching the connector step is ignored

### The Problem

Parameters configured on connector steps override document content - they don't merge. Document content is completely ignored when connector parameters are set.

**Example:** Salesforce Update with Id parameter ignores document payload from Map step.

### Why It Happens

Connector steps have two ways to provide data:
1. **Document content** - data from upstream Map/Message steps
2. **Connector parameters** - configured directly on connector step

When both are present, **parameters win completely** - document content is ignored.

### Wrong Pattern - Document Content Ignored

```xml
<!-- Map step builds complete payload including Id field -->
<map mapId="guid-for-salesforce-map"/>

<!-- Connector step also has Id parameter configured -->
<salesforce connectionId="conn-guid" operationId="op-guid">
  <dynamicProperties>
    <propertyvalue childKey="Id" key="recordFields" valueType="track">
      <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_RECORD_ID"/>
    </propertyvalue>
  </dynamicProperties>
</salesforce>
<!-- Result: Map output IGNORED, only DDP_RECORD_ID is sent (other fields missing!) -->
```

### Correct Patterns

**Solution Pattern A - Document-Only (Preferred for complex payloads):**
```xml
<!-- Map step builds complete payload including all fields -->
<map mapId="guid-for-salesforce-map"/>

<!-- Connector step with NO parameters - uses document content -->
<salesforce connectionId="conn-guid" operationId="op-guid">
  <!-- No dynamicProperties - document flows through normally -->
</salesforce>
```

**Solution Pattern B - Parameters-Only:** Set ALL fields via connector parameters (no Map step needed).

### Pre-Push Checklist

Decide: document-only OR parameters-only (never both). Test to verify complete payload sent.

## Issue #5: REST GET Document Clearing Pattern

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime error or unexpected behavior

### The Problem

REST GET requests should not send document content, but they inherit documents from upstream steps. This can cause execution errors or unexpected API behavior.

### Why It Happens

REST GET connectors:
- Should send only query parameters, no request body
- Inherit document content from previous steps in process flow
- Platform may attempt to send inherited document as request body
- Some APIs reject GET requests with body content

### Wrong Pattern - Inherited Document Causes Issues

```xml
<!-- Message step creates document -->
<message combined="false">
  <msgTxt>'{"search": "criteria"}'</msgTxt>
</message>

<!-- REST GET inherits document content -->
<connector connectionId="conn-guid" operationId="get-op-guid">
  <!-- GET request may fail due to unexpected body content -->
</connector>
```

### Correct Pattern - Clear Document Before GET

```xml
<!-- Message step creates document for other purposes -->
<message combined="false">
  <msgTxt>'{"search": "criteria"}'</msgTxt>
</message>

<!-- Empty Message step clears document content -->
<message combined="false">
  <msgTxt></msgTxt>
  <msgParameters/>
</message>

<!-- REST GET connector with clean slate -->
<connector connectionId="conn-guid" operationId="get-op-guid">
  <!-- No document content, only query parameters work correctly -->
</connector>
```

### When to Use

- Before any REST GET connector that doesn't need request body data
- When upstream steps create document content that shouldn't be sent to GET endpoint
- To prevent "request body not allowed" type errors from APIs

### Pre-Push Checklist

For REST GET: Check upstream creates content → Add empty Message step before GET if needed.

## Issue #6: REST Connector Profile Type Trap (historical — resolved in V11)

**Status:** Obsolete as of REST Client connector Version 11, which added selectable request/response profiles. Retained only as a note for pre-V11 runtimes.

Before Version 11, REST operations did not support request/response profiles, and older guidance was to strip `requestProfileType`/`responseProfileType`. On Version 11+ these attributes are supported when paired with a profile, and **inert when no profile is linked**. Document the supported pattern instead — see `components/rest_connector_operation_component.md`.

---

## Issue #7: Folder Placement Verification

**Frequency:** High
**Detection:** Design-time visibility (components appear in wrong folder)

### The Problem

Components land in account root folder instead of designated project folder despite configuration. No errors are thrown - components just appear in wrong location.

### Why It Happens

**Common causes:**
- Using `folderFullPath` instead of `folderId` attribute in XML
- Folder ID placeholder patterns (`{FOLDER_GUID}`) not resolved before API call
- Environment variable `BOOMI_TARGET_FOLDER` not resolving correctly
- Tool folder resolution logic issues
- Agent deliberately chose a different parent folder (e.g. to match existing account conventions) — build under `BOOMI_TARGET_FOLDER` when set, unless the user explicitly directed otherwise

### Wrong Patterns

```xml
<!-- Pattern 1: Using folderFullPath instead of folderId -->
<bns:Component componentId=""
               name="Component_Name"
               type="profile.json"
               folderFullPath="TargetFolder/ProjectFolder">
<!-- Result: Component lands in root folder -->

<!-- Pattern 2: Placeholder not resolved -->
<bns:Component componentId=""
               name="Component_Name"
               type="profile.json"
               folderId="{FOLDER_GUID}">
<!-- Result: Literal string "{FOLDER_GUID}" sent to API, lands in root -->

<!-- Pattern 3: Empty folder ID -->
<bns:Component componentId=""
               name="Component_Name"
               type="profile.json"
               folderId="">
<!-- Result: Component lands in root folder -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Actual Folder GUID

```xml
<bns:Component componentId=""
               name="Component_Name"
               type="profile.json"
               folderId="folder_abc123def">
<!-- Result: Component correctly placed in designated folder -->
```

### MANDATORY Verification Step

**ALWAYS verify folder placement immediately after component creation:**
1. **Check Boomi platform GUI** to confirm components landed in correct project folder
2. **If components appear in root folder**, STOP and investigate MCP tool folder resolution
3. **Never proceed with root folder components** - delete and recreate properly
4. **Verify resolution**: Check that folder ID resolves to actual GUID before API call

### Pre-Creation and Verification

Before creating: Folder created with `boomi-folder-create.sh`, folder ID is actual GUID, XML uses `folderId` attribute. After creating: Immediately verify placement in Boomi GUI - if in root folder, delete and troubleshoot before recreating.

## Issue #8: Common XML Schema Mistakes

**Frequency:** High
**Detection:** Design-time validation errors during push

### The Problem

Common XML attribute and element mistakes that cause validation errors during component push operations. These are easy to fix once identified but can be confusing without examples.

### Message Step Errors

**Wrong:**
```xml
<message combineDocuments="false" messageType="static">
```

**Error:**
```
cvc-attribute.3: The value 'combineDocuments' of attribute is not valid
```

**Correct:**
```xml
<message combined="false">
```

**Why:** Use `combined="false"` for single document output.

### Stop Step Errors

**Wrong:** `<stopaction/>`
**Correct:** `<stop continue="true"/>`
**Why:** Element name is `stop`, not `stopaction`.

### JSON Profile Type Errors

**Wrong:** `<bns:Component type="profile" subType="json">`
**Correct:** `<bns:Component type="profile.json">`
**Why:** JSON profiles use `type="profile.json"`, not separate subType.

### Set Properties Step Errors

**Wrong:**
```xml
<shape shapetype="setproperties">
  <setproperties>
    <!-- configuration -->
  </setproperties>
</shape>
```

**Error:**
```
cvc-enumeration-valid: Value 'setproperties' is not facet-valid
```

**Correct:**
```xml
<shape shapetype="documentproperties">
  <documentproperties>
    <!-- configuration -->
  </documentproperties>
</shape>
```

**Why:** Use `documentproperties` (not `setproperties`) for both shapetype and element.

### Component ID Mismatch Errors

**Wrong:** UPDATE with empty componentId
**Correct:** CREATE uses `componentId=""`, UPDATE uses actual platform GUID
**Why:** CREATE requires empty ID, UPDATE requires matching GUID.

## Issue #9: Map Function GUI Requirements

**Frequency:** Low
**Detection:** Map editor loads a blank canvas; browser console shows `Maximum call stack size exceeded`

### The Problem

A `<FunctionStep>` without `x`/`y` canvas coordinates cannot be rendered by the Boomi map editor — the canvas loads blank and the browser throws a stack-overflow error. API push and process execution are unaffected; the failure is GUI-only, and a single coordinate-less function is enough to trigger it.

### Wrong Pattern

```xml
<Functions optimizeExecutionOrder="true">
  <FunctionStep category="Scripting" key="1" name="Scripting"
                position="1" type="Scripting">
    <!-- Missing x/y coordinates -->
  </FunctionStep>
</Functions>
```

### Correct Pattern

```xml
<Functions optimizeExecutionOrder="true">
  <FunctionStep cacheEnabled="true" category="Scripting" key="1" name="Scripting"
                position="1" sumEnabled="false" type="Scripting" x="10.0" y="10.0">
    ...
  </FunctionStep>
</Functions>
```

### Attributes

- `x` and `y` — required for GUI rendering. Start the first function at `y="10.0"` and increment ~140px per function.
- `cacheEnabled`/`sumEnabled` — GUI-authored (`true`/`false`), not required for push, execution, or rendering. Emitting them matches what the GUI writes.

See `references/components/map_component_functions.md` for full detail.

### Additional Consideration

**Map function independence:** Within a map's `<Functions>`, each function widget must be standalone - never wire one function's output to another function's input. For multi-step transformations, prefer a User-Defined Function component (`transform.function`, where step-to-step chaining is legal - see `references/components/user_defined_function_component.md`); use a single scripting function only when the logic genuinely needs code.

## Issue #10: Process Layout Spacing

**Frequency:** Low
**Detection:** GUI label overlap

### The Problem

Steps positioned too close together cause label overlap in Boomi GUI, making process difficult to read.

### Correct Pattern

Use **250-unit spacing** between shapes on same horizontal line to prevent label overlap.

```xml
<shape x="250" y="100" shapetype="start">
  <!-- Start step -->
</shape>

<shape x="500" y="100" shapetype="connector">
  <!-- Connector step (250 units from start) -->
</shape>

<shape x="750" y="100" shapetype="stop">
  <!-- Stop step (250 units from connector) -->
</shape>
```

### Spacing Guidelines

- **Horizontal spacing**: 250 units between steps on same line
- **Vertical spacing**: 100 units for branches/parallel paths
- **Special offset**: Test data Message shapes ~100px below main path

## Issue #11: GUI Display Attributes

**Frequency:** Low
**Detection:** "null" displays in GUI (steps work correctly at runtime)

### The Problem

Missing display attributes cause "null" to appear in Boomi GUI instead of property names, though steps execute correctly.

### Affected Steps

**Connector Steps:**
```xml
<!-- Missing display attributes -->
<propertyvalue childKey="userId" key="queryParameters" valueType="track">
  <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_USER_ID"/>
  <!-- GUI shows "null" for property name -->
</propertyvalue>
```

**Correct:**
```xml
<propertyvalue childKey="userId" key="queryParameters"
               name="Query Parameters" valueType="track">
  <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_USER_ID"
                  propertyName="Dynamic Document Property - DDP_USER_ID"
                  defaultValue=""/>
</propertyvalue>
```

**Message/Notify Steps:**
```xml
<!-- Missing display attributes -->
<parametervalue key="1" valueType="track">
  <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_ORDER_ID"/>
  <!-- GUI shows "null" for property name -->
</parametervalue>
```

**Correct:**
```xml
<parametervalue key="1" valueType="track">
  <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_ORDER_ID"
                  propertyName="Dynamic Document Property - DDP_ORDER_ID"
                  defaultValue=""/>
</parametervalue>
```

### Required Attributes

- **Connector steps**: `name="Query Parameters"` on propertyvalue
- **All trackparameter elements**: `propertyName="..."` and `defaultValue=""`
- **Pattern**: All programmatically generated steps with `<trackparameter>` elements need GUI display attributes

### Impact

- **Runtime**: Steps execute correctly regardless of display attributes
- **GUI**: Shows "null" instead of property names, harder for humans to review
- **Best Practice**: Include display attributes for human-friendly processes

## Issue #12: Subprocess Test Payloads in Production

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Silent - test data used instead of real data

### The Problem

Temporary test Message shapes added for subprocess isolated testing are forgotten and left active in production deployments, causing processes to use test data instead of real data from parent process.

### Subprocess Testing Context

**Challenge:** When testing subprocess in isolation (via boomi-test-execute.sh or GUI), subprocess expects document from parent wrapper but has no data source.

**Common Solution:** Add temporary Message shape with test JSON payload that mimics expected structure from WSS request.

### Wrong Pattern - Test Code Left Active

```xml
<!-- Subprocess starts -->
<shape shapetype="start">
  <passthroughaction/>
</shape>

<!-- Test Message shape for isolated testing -->
<shape x="100" y="200" shapetype="message">
  <message combined="false">
    <msgTxt>'{"test": "data", "mode": "development"}'</msgTxt>
  </message>
</shape>

<!-- Business logic -->
<shape x="250" y="100" shapetype="map">
  <!-- Routes from both start AND test message -->
</shape>
<!-- Result: Production deployment uses test data! -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Test Code Removed

```xml
<!-- Subprocess starts -->
<shape shapetype="start">
  <passthroughaction/>
</shape>

<!-- Business logic directly after start -->
<shape x="250" y="100" shapetype="map">
  <!-- Routes only from start -->
</shape>
<!-- Result: Production uses real data from parent process -->
```

### Alternative: Dynamic Routing for Permanent Testability

If subprocess needs ongoing isolated testing capability:

1. Parent wrapper: Add Set Properties step setting `DPP_FROM_WRAPPER=true`
2. Subprocess: Start with Decision step checking if `DPP_FROM_WRAPPER` exists
3. Path when DPP present (called from parent) → proceed to business logic
4. Path when DPP absent (isolated testing) → Message shape with test payload → business logic
5. Subprocess remains permanently testable without removing test code

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying WSS wrapper + subprocess to production:
1. [ ] Identify all Message shapes in subprocess
2. [ ] Verify test Message shapes are removed OR
3. [ ] Verify dynamic routing properly detects parent vs isolated testing
4. [ ] Test parent-to-subprocess flow uses real data path
5. [ ] Document which Message shapes are permanent vs temporary

## Issue #13: SSL Certificate Verification in Testing

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime connection failures - SSL certificate verification errors

### The Problem

Development and testing environments often use self-signed SSL certificates. Python CLI tools and curl commands fail with SSL certificate verification errors when connecting to these environments, despite credentials being correct.

**Common Scenarios:**
- Local/custom Boomi instances with self-signed certificates
- Development runtime servers with non-production certificates
- Testing against localhost HTTPS endpoints

### Why It Happens

By default, both Python's `requests` library and `curl` refuse to connect to HTTPS endpoints with untrusted or self-signed certificates for security reasons.

### Wrong Pattern - Hard-Coded Insecure Flags

```bash
# Disabling SSL without configuration visibility
curl -k -X POST "${SERVER_BASE_URL}/ws/simple/endpoint"
```

**Problem:** Future developers don't know when `-k` flag is needed or why.

### Correct Pattern - Configurable SSL Verification

**Configuration Variables:**
```bash
# .env file
BOOMI_VERIFY_SSL=false        # Platform API SSL verification
SERVER_VERIFY_SSL=false       # Runtime server SSL verification
```

**Python Tools:** All CLI tools automatically respect `BOOMI_VERIFY_SSL` setting:
```python
# Handled automatically by tools
verify_ssl_config = self.config.get('api', {}).get('verify_ssl', 'true')
self.verify_ssl = str(verify_ssl_config).lower() != 'false'
response = requests.get(url, verify=self.verify_ssl)
```

**Curl Commands:** Use conditional SSL flag based on SERVER_VERIFY_SSL:
```bash
# SSL verification helper (add -k flag if SERVER_VERIFY_SSL=false)
SSL_FLAG=$([ "${SERVER_VERIFY_SSL}" = "false" ] && echo "-k" || echo "")

# Inline JSON with SSL support. curl_cfg puts the credentials on stdin and escapes
# them; -u would leak them to the command line.
source <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-common.sh
curl_cfg user "${SERVER_USERNAME}:${SERVER_TOKEN}" \
  | curl $SSL_FLAG -X POST -K - \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"key":"value"}' \
      "${SERVER_BASE_URL}/ws/simple/endpoint"
```

### Configuration Separation

Two separate settings control SSL verification in different contexts:

**BOOMI_VERIFY_SSL:**
- Controls: Platform API calls (component pull/push/create, deployments)
- Used by: All Python CLI tools in `<skill-path>/scripts/` directory
- Set to `false` when: Platform API URL uses self-signed certificate

**SERVER_VERIFY_SSL:**
- Controls: Runtime server HTTP testing (WSS listener curl commands)
- Used by: Manual curl testing commands
- Set to `false` when: Shared Web Server uses self-signed certificate

**Important:** Platform API and runtime server may use different certificates. Configure each independently based on your environment.

### Pre-Testing Checklist

Before testing processes:
1. Identify if environment uses self-signed certificates
2. Set `BOOMI_VERIFY_SSL=false` if platform API uses self-signed cert
3. Set `SERVER_VERIFY_SSL=false` if runtime server uses self-signed cert
4. For production environments, always use `true` (verify certificates)
5. Document SSL configuration in environment setup notes

### Security Note

Disabling SSL verification should only be used in development/testing environments with self-signed certificates. Production environments should always verify SSL certificates (`BOOMI_VERIFY_SSL=true` and `SERVER_VERIFY_SSL=true`).

## Issue #14: Branch Step Missing numBranches Attribute

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** GUI rendering error - blank canvas with JavaScript console error

### The Problem

Branch steps without the `numBranches` attribute deploy successfully and execute correctly at runtime, but cause the Boomi GUI to render a blank canvas when opening the process. JavaScript errors appear in browser console.

**Symptom:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'a')` JavaScript error in AtomSphere GUI when opening process.

### Why It Happens

The Boomi GUI canvas renderer expects the `numBranches` attribute to determine how many outgoing paths exist. Without this attribute, the GUI attempts to read a null value and fails to render the entire process canvas.

**Critical Detail:** Process deploys and executes successfully - only GUI rendering fails.

### Wrong Pattern - Blank Canvas Despite Successful Deployment

```xml
<!-- Branch step without numBranches -->
<shape image="branch_icon" name="shape2" shapetype="branch" x="240.0" y="48.0">
  <configuration>
    <branch/>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints>
    <dragpoint identifier="1" name="shape2.dragpoint1" text="1" toShape="shape4" x="416.0" y="56.0"/>
    <dragpoint identifier="2" name="shape2.dragpoint2" text="2" toShape="shape10" x="416.0" y="376.0"/>
  </dragpoints>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Deploys successfully, executes correctly, but GUI shows blank canvas -->
```

### Correct Pattern - GUI Renders Properly

```xml
<!-- Branch step with numBranches matching dragpoint count -->
<shape image="branch_icon" name="shape2" shapetype="branch" x="240.0" y="48.0">
  <configuration>
    <branch numBranches="2"/>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints>
    <dragpoint identifier="1" name="shape2.dragpoint1" text="1" toShape="shape4" x="416.0" y="56.0"/>
    <dragpoint identifier="2" name="shape2.dragpoint2" text="2" toShape="shape10" x="416.0" y="376.0"/>
  </dragpoints>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Deploys, executes, AND renders correctly in GUI -->
```

### Critical Rule

**Always include `numBranches` attribute and match it to dragpoint count:**
- 2 dragpoints → `numBranches="2"`
- 3 dragpoints → `numBranches="3"`
- 4 dragpoints → `numBranches="4"`

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any process with branch steps:
1. [ ] Locate all `<branch/>` elements in process XML
2. [ ] Verify each has `numBranches="N"` attribute
3. [ ] Count dragpoints and verify number matches `numBranches` value
4. [ ] Test GUI rendering after deployment to confirm canvas displays

## Issue #15: Stop Step Missing continue Attribute

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime failure and GUI rendering error

### The Problem

Stop steps without the `continue` attribute (bare `<stop/>`) are silently accepted by the platform API and deploy without error, but fail at both runtime and in the GUI. Both `continue="true"` and `continue="false"` are valid -- only the missing attribute triggers the failures.

**Symptoms:**
- **Runtime:** `NullPointerException` at `StopShape.init(StopShape.java:37)` — process never starts
- **GUI:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'a')` and `Maximum call stack size exceeded` JavaScript errors — process cannot be opened on canvas

### Why It Happens

The Boomi platform API performs no validation on the `continue` attribute during push or deploy. Both operations succeed silently. The failure surfaces only when the runtime engine or GUI renderer attempts to initialize the stop shape and encounters a null where the `continue` value is expected.

**Critical Detail:** The API and deployment pipeline give no indication anything is wrong. The failure is deferred to execution time (runtime) or canvas open (GUI).

### Wrong Pattern — Silent Deploy, Runtime + GUI Failure

```xml
<!-- Stop step without continue attribute -->
<shape image="stop_icon" name="shape9" shapetype="stop" x="1968.0" y="48.0">
  <configuration>
    <stop/>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints/>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Push and deploy succeed silently. Runtime: NullPointerException. GUI: stack overflow. -->
```

### Correct Pattern

```xml
<!-- Stop step with continue attribute -->
<shape image="stop_icon" name="shape9" shapetype="stop" x="1968.0" y="48.0">
  <configuration>
    <stop continue="true"/>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints/>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Deploys, executes, AND opens in GUI without errors -->
```

### Critical Rule

**Always include the `continue` attribute in all stop step configurations.** Either `continue="true"` or `continue="false"` — choose based on whether other paths should keep processing. The attribute is required for both runtime execution and GUI compatibility.

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any process with stop steps:
1. [ ] Locate all `<stop/>` elements in process XML
2. [ ] Verify each has the `continue` attribute (either `"true"` or `"false"`)
3. [ ] Test GUI opening after deployment to confirm process is accessible

## Issue #16: WSS Start Step Invalid actionType

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** GUI rendering error - empty action picklist in operation configuration

### The Problem

Web Services Server (WSS) start steps with invalid `actionType` values deploy successfully to the platform but fail to function as listeners. The Boomi GUI shows an empty action picklist when viewing the operation configuration, making it impossible to properly configure the operation through the GUI.

**Real-World Symptoms:**
- Process deploys without errors
- HTTP requests to the endpoint time out or return 404
- GUI shows empty dropdown for action selection in operation configuration
- No runtime errors - process simply doesn't listen for incoming requests

### Why It Happens

WSS start steps require `actionType="Listen"` - this is the only valid value for listener-based start shapes. Other plausible-sounding values like "EXECUTE", "POST", or "GET" pass platform validation during deployment but cause the operation configuration to fail silently.

**Root Cause:** Platform accepts invalid actionType during component push, but runtime initialization skips the listener setup when actionType doesn't match expected value.

### Wrong Pattern - Silent Listener Failure

```xml
<!-- WSS Start step with invalid actionType -->
<shape image="start" name="shape1" shapetype="start" userlabel="" x="96.0" y="94.0">
  <configuration>
    <connectoraction actionType="EXECUTE" allowDynamicCredentials="NONE" connectorType="wss" hideSettings="true" operationId="e468be9c-e350-4ed8-8841-e8001793031b">
      <parameters/>
      <dynamicProperties/>
    </connectoraction>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints>
    <dragpoint name="shape1.dragpoint1" toShape="shape5" x="304.0" y="120.0"/>
  </dragpoints>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Deploys successfully, but doesn't listen for requests! -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Working Listener

```xml
<!-- WSS Start step with correct actionType -->
<shape image="start" name="shape1" shapetype="start" userlabel="" x="96.0" y="94.0">
  <configuration>
    <connectoraction actionType="Listen" allowDynamicCredentials="NONE" connectorType="wss" hideSettings="true" operationId="e468be9c-e350-4ed8-8841-e8001793031b">
      <parameters/>
      <dynamicProperties/>
    </connectoraction>
  </configuration>
  <dragpoints>
    <dragpoint name="shape1.dragpoint1" toShape="shape5" x="304.0" y="120.0"/>
  </dragpoints>
</shape>
<!-- Result: Deploys and correctly listens for incoming HTTP requests -->
```

### Critical Rule

**Always use `actionType="Listen"` for WSS start steps.** This is the only valid value for listener-based connectors.

**Valid actionType values by start step type:**
- **WSS listeners**: `actionType="Listen"` (ONLY valid value)
- **Event Streams listeners**: `actionType="Listen"` (subscriber processes)
- **Passthrough**: `<passthroughaction/>` (no actionType attribute)

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any process with WSS start steps:
1. [ ] Locate all WSS start shapes (`connectorType="wss"`)
2. [ ] Verify each has `actionType="Listen"` (exact spelling, capitalization)
3. [ ] Confirm operationId references valid WSS operation component
4. [ ] Test endpoint after deployment to confirm listener is active

## Issue #17: Data Process Script Engine Attributes

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime error - cryptic error message about null script engine

### The Problem

Data Process Custom Scripting steps missing the required `language` attribute deploy successfully to the platform but fail at runtime with cryptic error: "Failed loading script engine null". The XML pushes without validation errors, but execution fails. (The `useCache` attribute is a performance flag, not required for execution — only `language` is load-bearing.)

**Real-World Symptoms:**
- Process deploys without errors
- Runtime execution fails with "Error executing data process"
- Error message shows "Failed loading script engine null"
- Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
- No design-time warnings or validation errors

### Why It Happens

The platform API accepts `<dataprocessscript>` elements without the `language` attribute during component push. However, at runtime, script engine initialization requires this attribute to determine which scripting engine to load. Without it, the engine lookup returns null, causing immediate NullPointerException.

**Root Cause:** Platform validation doesn't enforce required scripting attributes, but runtime engine requires them.

### Wrong Pattern - Cryptic Runtime Failure

```xml
<!-- Data Process step without required attributes -->
<step index="1" key="1" name="Custom Scripting" processtype="12">
  <dataprocessscript>
    <script><![CDATA[
      import java.util.Properties;
      import java.io.InputStream;

      for( int i = 0; i < dataContext.getDataCount(); i++ ) {
          InputStream is = dataContext.getStream(i);
          Properties props = dataContext.getProperties(i);

          props.setProperty("document.dynamic.userdefined.DDP_PROCESSED", "true");

          dataContext.storeStream(is, props);
      }
    ]]></script>
  </dataprocessscript>
</step>
<!-- Result: Deploys successfully, but fails at runtime with "Failed loading script engine null" -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Working Script Execution

```xml
<!-- Data Process step with required attributes -->
<step index="1" key="1" name="Custom Scripting" processtype="12">
  <dataprocessscript language="groovy2" useCache="true">
    <script><![CDATA[
      import java.util.Properties;
      import java.io.InputStream;

      for( int i = 0; i < dataContext.getDataCount(); i++ ) {
          InputStream is = dataContext.getStream(i);
          Properties props = dataContext.getProperties(i);

          props.setProperty("document.dynamic.userdefined.DDP_PROCESSED", "true");

          dataContext.storeStream(is, props);
      }
    ]]></script>
  </dataprocessscript>
</step>
<!-- Result: Deploys and executes successfully at runtime -->
```

### Critical Rule

**Always include the `language` attribute on `<dataprocessscript>` elements:**
- `language` - Specifies which script engine to load (REQUIRED). Valid tokens are `groovy2` (Groovy 2.4, the default), `groovy` (Groovy 1.5), and `javascript` (JavaScript). What matters for this error is that the attribute is *present*; any valid token avoids it.
- `useCache="true"` - Script compilation caching flag (recommended, not required for execution — a step runs whether it is `"true"`, `"false"`, or omitted).

Without the `language` attribute, the script engine cannot initialize and runtime execution fails immediately.

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any Data Process Custom Scripting steps:
1. [ ] Locate all `<dataprocessscript>` elements in component XML
2. [ ] Verify each has a `language` attribute (`groovy2` default; `groovy`/`javascript` also valid)
3. [ ] Optionally set `useCache="true"` (performance flag; not required for execution)
4. [ ] Test execution after deployment to confirm script runs successfully

## Issue #18: Notify perExecution="true" Loses Document Context

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime error - "Attempting dynamic document property extraction with no document"

### The Problem

Notify steps with `perExecution="true"` that reference DDPs, current data / document content, or profile elements fail at runtime. The error message suggests documents are missing, but in reality it is that the step ignores the documents and IMPORTANTLY errors if it attempts to reference document level data. If no document level data is attempted to be referenced, the documents will continue to flow through as expected.

### Why It Happens

`perExecution="true"` changes the Notify step to execute once per process execution instead of once per document. In this mode, there is no "current document" - the step runs outside the document iteration loop.

**Critical clarification:** The notify step with perException=true does NOT destroy DDPs or documents. Subsequent steps can access DDPs normally. But if the error is encountered, further processing down that path will halt, breaking the process.

### Wrong Pattern - Error When Step References DDPs

```xml
<notify perExecution="true" ...>
  <notifyMessage>Processing user: {1}</notifyMessage>
  <notifyParameters>
    <parametervalue key="1" valueType="track">
      <trackparameter propertyId="dynamicdocument.DDP_USER_EMAIL"/>
    </parametervalue>
  </notifyParameters>
</notify>
<!-- Result: "Attempting dynamic document property extraction with no document" -->
```

### Correct Patterns

**Option A - Remove perExecution (log per document):**
```xml
<notify perExecution="false" ...>
  <notifyMessage>Processing user: {1}</notifyMessage>
  <!-- DDPs work fine with perExecution="false" -->
</notify>
```

**Option B - Use static/DPP values only:**
```xml
<notify perExecution="true" ...>
  <notifyMessage>Process started at {1}</notifyMessage>
  <notifyParameters>
    <parametervalue key="1" valueType="date">
      <dateparameter dateparametertype="current" datetimemask="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"/>
    </parametervalue>
  </notifyParameters>
</notify>
<!-- Works - no document-level references -->
```

**Option C - Copy DDP to DPP first:**
```xml
<!-- Step 1: Set Properties copies DDP to DPP -->
<!-- Step 2: Notify uses DPP instead -->
<notify perExecution="true" ...>
  <notifyMessage>Batch processing for: {1}</notifyMessage>
  <notifyParameters>
    <parametervalue key="1" valueType="process">
      <processparameter processproperty="DPP_BATCH_NAME"/>
    </parametervalue>
  </notifyParameters>
</notify>
```

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing Notify steps with `perExecution="true"`:
1. [ ] Verify no DDP references in parameters
2. [ ] Verify no `valueType="current"` (document content)
3. [ ] Verify no profile element references
4. [ ] Only static, date, or DPP references allowed

## Issue #19: WSS Listener Path Collision

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Silent - requests route to wrong/stale process

### The Problem

Multiple deployed processes on the same WSS path cause unpredictable routing. Requests may hit an older process instead of the newly deployed one.

**Symptoms:** Process deploys successfully but returns old responses. Process Reporting shows executions hitting processes "last updated weeks ago."

### Diagnostic

`ListenerStatus` is the authoritative registry of active listeners on a runtime, but **its entries do not expose the listener's HTTP path**. Each entry contains only:

- `listenerId` — the listener-bearing **process** componentId (not the operation componentId)
- `status` — `listening` | `paused` | `errored`
- `connectorType` — e.g. `wss`

So the registry can answer "what listeners are active on this runtime?" but cannot directly answer "are any of them on the same path?" To compare paths, you must enrich each entry by fetching its process and operation components.

**Step 1 — enumerate active listeners via ListenerStatus async query:**

```bash
# curl_cfg puts the credentials on stdin and escapes them; -u would leak them to
# the command line.
source <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-common.sh
auth() { curl_cfg user "BOOMI_TOKEN.${BOOMI_USERNAME}:${BOOMI_API_TOKEN}"; }

# Start async query
auth | curl -K - -X POST "${BOOMI_API_URL}/${BOOMI_ACCOUNT_ID}/async/ListenerStatus/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"QueryFilter":{"expression":{"operator":"EQUALS","property":"containerId","argument":["'${BOOMI_TEST_ATOM_ID}'"]}}}'
# Returns {"asyncToken":{"token":"ListenerStatus-..."}}

# Poll for results (replace TOKEN)
auth | curl -K - "${BOOMI_API_URL}/${BOOMI_ACCOUNT_ID}/async/ListenerStatus/response/{TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

A successful response has the shape:

```json
{
  "@type": "AsyncOperationResult",
  "result": [
    { "@type": "ListenerStatus", "listenerId": "<process componentId>", "status": "listening", "connectorType": "wss" }
  ],
  "numberOfResults": 1,
  "responseStatusCode": 200
}
```

**Step 2 — resolve each `listenerId` to its registered path** (only needed for collision comparison):

1. `GET Component/{listenerId}` — fetch the process XML
2. Locate the start step's `connectoraction[@connectorType='wss']` element and read its `operationId`
3. `GET Component/{operationId}` — fetch the operation XML
4. Read `WebServicesServerListenAction/@objectName` and `@operationType`
5. The path is `/ws/simple/{lowercase(operationType)}{SentenceCase(objectName)}`

For a fast path-level collision check **without** the per-listener Component enrichment, hit the suspected path directly with `<skill-path>/scripts/boomi-wss-test.sh --method HEAD` and check the status code — a non-404 with valid perimeter credentials means a listener is registered there. Note that this approach is sensitive to the credentials being correct: see `references/platform_entities/shared_web_server.md` for the cloud-perimeter behavior that conflates "wrong creds" and "listener exists" if not handled carefully.

### Prevention

Use unique, project-specific objectName values in WSS Operations:

```xml
<!-- Collision-prone -->
<WssOperation objectName="products" operationType="create"/>

<!-- Unique per project -->
<WssOperation objectName="productsMyProject" operationType="create"/>
```

### Resolution

Change objectName to unique path, redeploy, and undeploy stale processes via AtomSphere GUI.

## Issue #20: MCP Server Profile/Schema Sync

**Frequency:** High
**Detection:** Silent - old validation rules active after schema changes

### The Problem

MCP Server `toolSchema` changes don't propagate to the JSON Profile. The tool validates against the old profile until you reimport and redeploy.

### Correct Pattern

After any schema change:
1. Reimport JSON Profile from new schema
2. Update operation (`toolSchema`, `cookie/value`, `defaultValue` must all match)
3. Redeploy ALL processes using this connection

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh active-development/profile.json/mcp-profile.xml
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh active-development/connector-action/mcp-operation.xml
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh active-development/process/mcp-process.xml
```

## Issue #21: MCP Server 503 After Valid Auth

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime - 503 "Server Shutting Down" after successful token validation

### The Problem

MCP Server returns 503 after auth succeeds. Token is valid, but session initialization fails.

### Workaround

Restart the Atom. Redeploying alone does not fix this - the Atom itself needs to be restarted.

---

## Issue #22: EDI TagList elementKey Target

**Frequency:** High (any EDI profile with qualified repeating loops)
**Detection:** Runtime - map produces more output documents than expected, or address/child segment data silently missing

### The Problem

When configuring tagLists on an EDI profile, `elementKey` must point to the **loop** element, not a segment within the loop. Two failure modes:

**No tagLists**: Mapping from a repeating EDI loop (e.g., N1 loop with N1*ST and N1*BT) produces separate output documents per loop iteration. Header and detail data are duplicated across all split documents.

**Segment-level elementKey**: A segment key resolves, and qualifier-matched instances of that segment route correctly — the defect is scope. Pointing `elementKey` at a segment (e.g., the N1 segment) instead of the containing loop causes splitting AND silent data loss: sibling segments within the loop (N3 address, N4 city/state/zip) are excluded from scope entirely. No error is raised.

### The Fix

Set `elementKey` to the loop's key, not a segment's key. With loop-level `elementKey`, the map consolidates qualified iterations into different target fields of a single output document per transaction set.

```xml
<!-- CORRECT: elementKey points to the N1 Loop (key=20) -->

## Issue #23: Empty processOverrides Hides Extensions Until Redeclared

**Frequency:** High (any pull-modify-push workflow on processes with extensions)
**Detection:** Silent - extension values disappear from environment after deployment

### The Problem

Pushing a process with empty `<bns:processOverrides/>` or empty `<Overrides xmlns=""/>` removes that process's extension declarations from the environment. Values that had been set via the Environment Extensions API are hidden — they no longer appear in GET responses and are not used at runtime.

The values are **not destroyed**: redeploying the process with its original `<bns:processOverrides>` block restored brings the declarations back, and the previously-set values reappear at their prior state. Recovery does not require a snapshot — only a clean redeploy.

### Why It Happens

The platform stores exactly what is pushed. An empty processOverrides element is not "no change" -- it is "this process has no extensions." When deployed, the environment removes the extension declarations and the values become orphaned (preserved server-side but invisible to API and runtime until a matching declaration returns).

### Wrong Pattern - Extensions Silently Hidden

```xml
<!-- Pulled process had extensions, but processOverrides was emptied or left as self-closing -->
<bns:Component ...>
  <bns:object>...</bns:object>
  <bns:processOverrides/>
</bns:Component>
<!-- Result: After push + deploy, this process's extension values are hidden from API and runtime -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Preserve Extensions

```xml
<bns:Component ...>
  <bns:object>...</bns:object>
  <bns:processOverrides>
    <Overrides xmlns="">
      <Connections>
        <ConnectionOverride id="c7d489dc-...">
          <field id="url" label="URL" overrideable="true" xpath="HttpSettings/@url"/>
        </ConnectionOverride>
      </Connections>
      <Properties>
        <PropertyOverride name="DPP_MY_SETTING"/>
      </Properties>
    </Overrides>
  </bns:processOverrides>
</bns:Component>
<!-- Result: Extension declarations preserved after push + deploy -->
```

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any process that may have extensions:
1. Check if pulled XML contained populated `<bns:processOverrides>` content
2. Never replace populated overrides with self-closing `<bns:processOverrides/>`
3. When creating new processes, use self-closing form only if the process genuinely has no extensions

### Recovery

If a push has already hidden extensions, restore the original `<bns:processOverrides>` block in the process XML and redeploy — values come back with their prior settings. No API replay is required.

## Issue #24: DPP valueType="track" Returns Empty

**Frequency:** High
**Detection:** Silent - DPP values appear as empty string in output

### The Problem

Reading a Dynamic Process Property (DPP) with `valueType="track"` / `<trackparameter>` always returns empty string, regardless of whether the DPP was set by environment extensions, Set Properties steps, or Groovy scripts. No error is thrown -- the value is simply empty.

Additionally, `valueType="track"` with `perExecution="true"` (no document context) throws: `ProcessException: Attempting tracked document property extraction with no document`.

### Why It Happens

`valueType="track"` with `<trackparameter>` is designed for Dynamic **Document** Properties (DDPs). Despite `propertyId="process.DPP_NAME"` appearing to reference a DPP, the track mechanism does not resolve process-level properties.

### Wrong Pattern - DPP Always Empty

```xml
<parametervalue key="0" valueType="track">
  <trackparameter defaultValue="" propertyId="process.DPP_SF_CLIENT_ID"
                  propertyName="Dynamic Process Property - DPP_SF_CLIENT_ID"/>
</parametervalue>
<!-- Result: Always returns empty string, silently -->
```

### Correct Pattern - DPP Value Retrieved

```xml
<parametervalue key="0" valueType="process">
  <processparameter processproperty="DPP_SF_CLIENT_ID" processpropertydefaultvalue=""/>
</parametervalue>
<!-- Result: Returns the actual DPP value -->
```

### The Rule

- **DPPs** -> always use `valueType="process"` with `<processparameter>`
- **DDPs** -> use `valueType="track"` with `<trackparameter>`

This applies everywhere a `<parametervalue>` element is used: Message steps, Notify steps, Set Properties source values, and connector dynamic properties.

## Issue #25: Identity Field mandatory="true" on Map Output

**Frequency:** High (any multi-record flat file profile used as map output)
**Detection:** Runtime error - `MANDATORY_ELEMENT_MISSING`

### The Problem

Multi-record flat file profiles with `mandatory="true"` on identity fields (Code/Qual fields with `useToIdentifyFormat="true"`) cause runtime errors when the profile is used as a **map output**. Unmapped record types have empty identity fields, which triggers mandatory validation failure.

**Error message:**
```
[Output ProfileLocation: RecordName/Elements/Code; DocumentLocation: Record (1,0), FileRow 1]: Invalid Data Element: MANDATORY_ELEMENT_MISSING
```

### Why It Happens

When a flat file profile is used as map output, Boomi validates all `mandatory="true"` fields on every record type in the output document. If only some record types are mapped, unmapped record types produce empty identity fields. Those empty fields fail mandatory validation.

### Wrong Pattern - Runtime Error on Unmapped Records

```xml
<FlatFileElement name="RecordType" startColumn="0" length="3"
                useToIdentifyFormat="true" identityValue="139"
                mandatory="true" .../>
<!-- Result: MANDATORY_ELEMENT_MISSING when this profile is map output and not all records are mapped -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Identity Detection Works Without Mandatory

```xml
<FlatFileElement name="RecordType" startColumn="0" length="3"
                useToIdentifyFormat="true" identityValue="139"
                mandatory="false" .../>
<!-- Result: Identity detection works correctly; no validation error on unmapped records -->
```

### The Rule

**Default to `mandatory="false"` on identity fields** (`useToIdentifyFormat="true"`). Identity detection uses `identityValue` comparison alone — it does not depend on the mandatory flag. Since profiles are often reused across input and output contexts, `mandatory="false"` on identity fields avoids this error without sacrificing detection behavior.

`mandatory="true"` on identity fields is only safe when the profile will never be used as map output, or when every record type will always be mapped.

---

## Issue #26: Identity Value Trimming in Data Positioned Profiles

**Frequency:** High (any data positioned profile with `detectFormat="uniquevalues"`)
**Detection:** Silent in multi-record scenarios (record missing from output, no error). Explicit ERROR if the unmatched record is the only record in the data.

### The Problem

Boomi trims extracted field values before comparing them against `identityValue` in `uniquevalues` detection. But it does NOT trim the `identityValue` attribute itself. If `identityValue` contains trailing whitespace, the comparison fails silently.

**Multi-record scenario:** Other records match normally. The mismatched record silently vanishes — no error, no warning, the section is simply absent from output.

**Single-record scenario:** No records match. Error: `"No data produced from map, please check source profile and make sure it matches source data."`

This is one specific cause of the zero-document map failure — see Issue #41 for the general case.

### Why It Happens

In a data positioned profile, fields have fixed widths. If an identity value is shorter than the field width (e.g., "BF" in a 3-char field), the extracted value is "BF " (padded with trailing space). Boomi trims this to "BF" before comparison. But `identityValue="BF "` is compared as-is — "BF" ≠ "BF ".

### Wrong Pattern - Silent Record Loss

```xml
<!-- Field is 3 chars wide, but "BF" is only 2 chars -->
<FlatFileElement name="Qualifier" startColumn="2" length="3"
                useToIdentifyFormat="true" identityValue="BF "
                mandatory="false" .../>
<!-- Result: Extracted "BF " trimmed to "BF", compared against "BF " → no match → record vanishes -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Trimmed Identity Value

```xml
<FlatFileElement name="Qualifier" startColumn="2" length="3"
                useToIdentifyFormat="true" identityValue="BF"
                mandatory="false" .../>
<!-- Result: Extracted "BF " trimmed to "BF", compared against "BF" → match -->
```

### The Rule

**Always set `identityValue` to the trimmed identifier text, never padded to field width.** This applies regardless of the field's `length` attribute. Values that already fill the full field width (e.g., "CTL" in a 3-char field) are unaffected since trimming doesn't change them.

### Debugging Tip

If a specific record type is missing from output but others parse correctly, check whether its identity value is shorter than the field width. This is the most common cause.

## Issue #27: Listener Process with Default Process Options

**Frequency:** High (any listener process created without adjusting process options)
**Detection:** Silent - concurrent requests queued or rejected instead of processed in parallel

### The Problem

Listener processes (WSS, FSS, MCP Server, Event Streams) created with default process options have `allowSimultaneous="false"`, which causes concurrent requests to queue or fail. WSS processes return HTTP 503 to concurrent callers. Other listener types queue or reject subsequent triggers while one execution is in progress.

### Why It Happens

New processes default to `allowSimultaneous="false"` and `updateRunDates="true"` — appropriate for scheduled/batch processes but wrong for listeners. The Boomi GUI shows a yellow banner recommending changes when configuring a listener start step, but programmatic creation skips this prompt.

### Wrong Pattern - Listener with Default Options

```xml
<process allowSimultaneous="false" enableUserLog="false" processLogOnErrorOnly="false" purgeDataImmediately="false" stopProcessingIfZeroDocuments="true" updateRunDates="true" workload="general">
  <shapes>
    <shape image="start" name="shape1" shapetype="start" userlabel="" x="96.0" y="94.0">
      <configuration>
        <connectoraction actionType="Listen" connectorType="wss" .../>
      </configuration>
    </shape>
  </shapes>
</process>
<!-- Result: Second concurrent HTTP request gets HTTP 503; updateRunDates adds per-execution overhead -->
```

### Correct Pattern - Listener with Recommended Options

```xml
<process allowSimultaneous="true" enableUserLog="false" processLogOnErrorOnly="false" purgeDataImmediately="false" stopProcessingIfZeroDocuments="true" updateRunDates="false" workload="general">
  <shapes>
    <shape image="start" name="shape1" shapetype="start" userlabel="" x="96.0" y="94.0">
      <configuration>
        <connectoraction actionType="Listen" connectorType="wss" .../>
      </configuration>
    </shape>
  </shapes>
</process>
<!-- Result: Concurrent requests processed in parallel; no run date overhead -->
```

### Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing any process with a listener start step:
1. [ ] Verify `allowSimultaneous="true"` on the `<process>` element
2. [ ] Verify `updateRunDates="false"` on the `<process>` element
3. [ ] Applies to all listener types: WSS, FSS, MCP Server, Event Streams Listen

See `components/process_component.md` for the full decision table of recommended values by start step type.

## Issue #28: SF Operation Missing Sorts Element

**Frequency:** High (any programmatically-created Salesforce query operation)
**Detection:** GUI white screen — `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'a')` when opening the operation editor

### The Problem

A Salesforce query operation missing the `<Sorts/>` element inside `<SalesforceObject>` causes the Boomi GUI operation editor to white-screen crash. The runtime is unaffected — queries execute fine without it.

### Why It Happens

The GWT-based operation editor assumes `<Sorts>` exists as a child of `<SalesforceObject>` and NPEs when it's null. GUI-imported operations always include this element (even when empty). Programmatically-created operations may omit it.

### Wrong Pattern — GUI Crash

```xml
<SalesforceObject name="Account" objectAction="query">
  <FieldList>...</FieldList>
  <Filter>...</Filter>
  <!-- No <Sorts/> element — GUI white-screens -->
  <SalesforceObject name="Child Objects" objectType="childObjects"/>
  <SalesforceObject name="Parent Objects" objectType="parentObjects"/>
</SalesforceObject>
```

### Correct Pattern

```xml
<SalesforceObject name="Account" objectAction="query">
  <FieldList>...</FieldList>
  <Filter>...</Filter>
  <Sorts/>
  <SalesforceObject name="Child Objects" objectType="childObjects"/>
  <SalesforceObject name="Parent Objects" objectType="parentObjects"/>
</SalesforceObject>
```

### The Rule

Always include `<Sorts/>` inside `<SalesforceObject>` on query operations, after `</Filter>` and before child `<SalesforceObject>` elements. Even when empty, its presence is required for GUI rendering.

## Issue #29: Component Locking Blocks All API Updates

**Frequency:** Medium (accounts with Component Locking enabled)
**Detection:** Push fails with HTTP 400 — `"Component {id} is currently locked by another user. To complete this action, the component must be unlocked."`

### The Problem

When Component Locking is enabled in a Boomi account and a user holds a lock on a component (via the GUI), all API updates to that component are rejected with HTTP 400 — including API calls authenticated as the lock holder.

### Key Facts

- **Reads are unaffected** — GET/pull succeeds regardless of lock state.
- **Writes are blocked for all API users** — locks are GUI-session-scoped, not user-scoped. The API is always treated as a separate session.
- **No lock query API** — there is no endpoint to check lock status. The only way to discover a lock is to attempt a push and observe the 400.
- **No API lock/unlock** — locks can only be acquired and released in the GUI.
- **Error message is identical** regardless of whether the API credentials match the lock holder — it always says "locked by another user."

### The Rule

When a push fails with this error, inform the user that the component is locked and must be unlocked in the Boomi GUI. Do not retry — the lock state cannot be changed via API.

---

## Issue #30: Groovy Syntax Errors Deploy Successfully

**Frequency:** Medium
**Detection:** Runtime error surfaced only in ProcessLog — push and deploy complete cleanly

### The Problem

Groovy scripts inside `<dataprocessscript>` components are compiled by the Atom runtime at first execution, not at push or deploy time. A syntactically invalid script pushes and deploys without errors, then fails at runtime with `CompilationFailedException` (or similar) visible only in the execution log.

**Real-World Symptoms:**
- Component push returns HTTP 200
- `boomi-deploy.sh` prints `SUCCESS: Deployed`
- Process execution fails with a Groovy compile error (unexpected token, unclosed brace, unresolved type, etc.)
- The error is visible only by inspecting the ProcessLog for the failed execution

### Why It Happens

The platform API validates XML schema at push and deployment metadata at deploy, but the `<script>` body is stored as opaque text. Compilation happens inside the runtime the first time a script executes, via the script engine selected by the `language` attribute on `<dataprocessscript>`. Push-time and deploy-time checks never exercise the script parser, so syntactic issues cannot surface until execution. (The same deploy-clean / execution-fail pattern applies to JavaScript scripts, which the Nashorn engine likewise compiles on first execution.)

### Wrong Pattern — Treating Deploy Success as Verification

```
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh process/your_process.xml   # 200 OK
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh process/your_process.xml            # SUCCESS: Deployed
# — change considered verified, process never executed —
```

### Correct Pattern — Execute and Inspect the ProcessLog

```
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh process/your_process.xml
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh process/your_process.xml
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-test-execute.sh --process-id <guid>
# inspect ProcessLog for Groovy compile/runtime errors before considering the change verified
```

### The Rule

After any change to a `<dataprocessscript>` body, execute the process, then verify **both** that the ProcessLog is free of errors **and** that observable outputs (DDPs, routing, document content) match intent. Deploy-clean and error-free execution are not, by themselves, correctness signals for script body changes.

## Issue #31: Connection-Override Field Missing `xpath` Is Silently Inert

**Frequency:** High (any hand-authored or round-tripped `<bns:processOverrides>` connection override)
**Detection:** Silent — no deploy error, no execution error; the connector simply uses the wrong value

### The Problem

A connection-override `<field>` declared `overrideable="true"` but missing its connector-specific `xpath` attribute is *declared but inert*. The `xpath` is the binding that injects the environment-extension value onto the target attribute in the connection XML; without it the value is never applied.

The defect is dangerous because everything *looks* configured:
- The field shows as overrideable in the Boomi GUI extensions tab.
- The extensions GET (`boomi-extensions.sh get`) reports the field with `useDefault=false` and the set value.
- There is no deploy warning and no execution error.

At request time, the connector silently falls back to the connection component's baked-in default. It is **environment-masked** — it works on any environment where the connection's default already equals the desired value, and only fails where they differ (the classic "works in test, fails in prod"). It is also **redeploy-proof**: the broken declaration lives in the component, so redeploying reships it. Other override sections (e.g. `DefinedProcessPropertyOverrides`) bind independently and are unaffected, so credentials can resolve from extensions while a connection field does not — sending real credentials to the wrong host.

### Wrong Pattern — Declared but Inert

```xml
<ConnectionOverride id="241f2935-...">
  <field id="url" label="URL" overrideable="true"/>
</ConnectionOverride>
<!-- Override appears active in GUI and API, but the URL extension is ignored at runtime -->
```

### Correct Pattern — `xpath` Binds the Override

```xml
<ConnectionOverride id="241f2935-...">
  <field id="url" label="URL" overrideable="true" xpath="HttpSettings/@url"/>
</ConnectionOverride>
<!-- The URL extension value is injected into HttpSettings/@url at runtime -->
```

Emit the complete canonical `<ConnectionOverride>` block the platform generates for the connector type — every field enumerated, each with its own `xpath` — rather than a hand-picked subset. See references/components/process_extensions.md § Connection Overrides for how to obtain it.

### Detection

Flag any self-closing overrideable `<field>` that has no `xpath`:

```
grep -oE '<field id="[^"]*" label="[^"]*" overrideable="true"/>' process.xml
```

Any match is a declared-but-inert override (a correctly bound field ends with `xpath="..."/>`, not `overrideable="true"/>`).

## Issue #32: Agent Step Errors Return In-Band, Not as Faults

**Frequency:** High (any process using an Agent step)
**Detection:** Silent — the shape reports success and the execution reports `COMPLETE`

### The Problem

Agent Garden answers an agent-side rejection with **HTTP 200** and a `{"success":false,"error":"..."}` body. The connector sees a successful call and emits that body as the output document. Nothing raises, so the shape reports success, the execution reports `COMPLETE`, and **a Try/Catch around the Agent step never fires** — there is no fault to catch.

A process relying on Try/Catch for agent failures therefore has no error handling at all and reports success on total failure. The operation's `returnApplicationErrors` attribute does not change this; `true` and `false` behave identically.

Agent-side rejections include: file uploads not enabled, file type or format rejected, too many or oversized files, and input not matching a structured agent's schema.

### Wrong Pattern — Try/Catch as the Only Handler

```
Try/Catch
  └── Agent Step → downstream
      catch path: never taken — failures flow downstream as ordinary documents
```

### Correct Pattern — Decision on `success`, Try/Catch for Transport

```
Try/Catch
  └── Agent Step → Decision (success == true?)
                     ├── true  → downstream
                     └── false → Exception step
      catch path: transport faults only (read/connect timeout, unreachable host)
```

The Decision reads `success` from the returned envelope. Keep the Try/Catch — transport faults *do* fail the shape (`Shape executed with errors`, message in `meta.base.catcherrorsmessage`).

### Related Traps

- **Execution status is not a health signal.** Both failure classes finish `COMPLETE` — the rejection because nothing raised, a *caught* transport fault because the catch absorbed it.
- **Guardrail blocks return `success: true`** with the refusal as the payload, so a `success` check passes them. Only content inspection catches those.
- **A conversational agent's error output is JSON, not SSE**, so the `event: message` extractor returns `""` and discards the error. Branch on `success` before extracting.

### Detection

Rejections are refused before inference, so they return in a fraction of a real run's time. An Agent step that returns far faster than usual has usually been rejected.

## Issue #33: Disk V2 Directory Outside `work/` Denied on Cloud Runtimes

**Frequency:** High (any Disk V2 connection built without a stated runtime target)
**Detection:** Runtime error — `java.io.FilePermission` denial on execution; push and deploy succeed

### The Problem

On cloud runtimes, Disk V2 writes are permitted under `work` and its subdirectories — any depth, auto-created with `createDir=true` — and denied outside it. `/tmp` is the common case.

For an ordinary path, the constraint is **location, not path form**: a relative path outside `work` is denied exactly as an absolute one is. A `..` traversal segment is a separate rule — see § Traversal Is Blocked as a Form below.

Every denied path still pushes and deploys cleanly — nothing surfaces at design time.

The restriction covers the `connector.disk-sdk.directory` document property as well as the connection field, so a compliant connection does not guarantee a compliant write target.

### Two Error Shapes

Which message appears depends on whether the target directory already exists. Both contain `access denied ("java.io.FilePermission"`.

**Target must be created** — directory creation denied, mode `write`, no exception class in the message:

```
[-1] access denied ("java.io.FilePermission" "{configured-directory}" "write")
```

**Target already exists** — existence check denied, mode `read`, wrapped in a connector message:

```
[-1] Cannot check for the existence of the file because it cannot be read or written to: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.io.FilePermission" "/tmp" "read")
```

The quoted path is echoed exactly as configured — not normalized, not resolved to an absolute path, no filename appended.

### Traversal Is Blocked as a Form

A `..` segment is denied even when it resolves back inside `work` — the permission check matches the literal, un-normalized path string. For the denial shapes, see `references/components/diskv2_connector_operation_component.md` § fileName with Subdirectory Paths.

### Wrong Pattern — A Location Outside `work`

```xml
<field id="directory" type="string" value="/tmp"/>
```

### Correct Pattern

```xml
<field id="directory" type="string" value="work/output"/>
```

### The Rule

Default every Disk V2 directory value to `work/{purpose}`.

### Detection

Config side — flag any directory value not under `work`, and inspect every override:

```
grep -n 'id="directory"' connection.xml | grep -v 'value="work[/"]'
grep -n 'connector.disk-sdk.directory' process.xml
```

Anchor the `work` match on `/` or the closing quote — a bare `value="work` prefix also accepts non-compliant siblings such as `workflow/out`.

Log side — key on the substring common to every shape. Do not pin the mode word (both `read` and `write` occur) and do not require the exception class (absent from the creation-denied shape):

```
grep -F 'access denied ("java.io.FilePermission"' process.log
```

## Issue #34: Split Documents Preserves the Parent Wrapper

**Frequency:** High (any split followed by profile-keyed field access)
**Detection:** Silent in Set Properties and Route (execution `COMPLETE`). Explicit ERROR in a Map.

### The Problem

A Split Documents step reduces the array or repeating element to one occurrence but keeps the parent wrapper: `{"orders":[A,B,C]}` yields `{"orders":[A]}`, `{"orders":[B]}`, `{"orders":[C]}`. XML behaves the same. Keyed against a flattened single-element profile:

- **Set Properties** returns an empty string
- **Route** matches nothing, so every document falls to the Default path
- **Map** fails with `No data produced from map '<name>', please check source profile and make sure it matches source data`, emitting zero documents, so downstream steps are skipped

The Map case is one specific cause of the zero-document map failure — see Issue #41 for the general case.

### The Rule

Downstream of a split, reuse the same profile and nested element keys as upstream of it. See `references/steps/data_process_step.md` § Output Document Shape.

---

## Issue #35: Account Default Branch Redirects Unqualified Operations

**Frequency:** Low overall, but affects every operation in an account where it is set
**Detection:** Silent by default — a write intended for main lands elsewhere and reports success

### The Problem

A request that names no branch resolves to the account's default branch. The setting is account-wide, so it reaches developers who never work on branches themselves, and it persists until someone changes it back in the UI. Requires branch & merge enabled; where those endpoints are denied every operation is on main (see `branch_merge_api_behavior.md` § Non-Branch-Enabled Account Behavior).

### Detection

- A push reports a new version, but main's version did not change.
- A component readable on main reports `ComponentId is invalid` on push.
- `bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh default` reports the current setting (read-only).

Create and push print the branch the platform used — `Create landed on branch:`, `Push landed on branch:` — and warn when it differs from the branch requested. A pull prints `Pull read from branch:` only when it named no branch; a `--branch` pull suppresses it, because an inherited component returns the parent's `branchId` and the report would be misleading. Compare what is printed against the branch you intended.

### Resolution

Pass `--branch main` for operations that must target main. The default is set in the UI only (Branch Management) — ask the user to change it there when the reported branch disagrees with intent.

`ComponentId is invalid` does not distinguish "invisible to the addressed branch" from "no such ID". Pull and push diagnose it automatically and print a `DIAGNOSIS:` line; for any other component, `boomi-version-history.sh --component-id <id>` spans every branch, so the BRANCH column names the branches that can see it and zero rows mean the ID is wrong.

## Issue #36: Unresolvable `customOperationType` on a Custom Connector Operation

**Frequency:** Medium (any hand-authored SDK connector operation component)
**Detection:** Silent at every automated checkpoint — the GUI is the only surface that reports it

### The Problem

A custom connector Operation component whose `customOperationType` names a `customTypeId` the connector descriptor never declared cannot be resolved. The Boomi GUI reports it as:

> The "EXECUTE" action is no longer available. Visit our documentation to learn about available options.

The wording points at a platform deprecation. It is not one — EXECUTE is a current operation type, and all eight `OperationType` constants exist in the SDK. The message echoes the component's `customOperationType` attribute verbatim, which is why it can name a perfectly valid operation type: a component with `operationType="EXECUTE"` *and* `customOperationType="EXECUTE"` produces this banner about the second attribute while the first is entirely valid.

**The banner is not the whole symptom — the operation form collapses.** Because the platform cannot locate the descriptor's operation definition, every descriptor-driven part of the form disappears: the Object dropdown goes blank and the operation's declared fields are not rendered at all, replaced by a generic Request Profile chooser. The stored field values remain in the XML and still reach the connector at runtime, so they are live but invisible and uneditable. A GUI save from that state has no field to write back, risking silent loss of values the form never showed.

Everything else passes: the connector's Java compiles, descriptor validation succeeds, the connector version uploads, the component pushes, the deploy succeeds, and **the process executes to COMPLETE**. The runtime resolves the operation from `operationType` alone and ignores an unresolvable `customOperationType`, so the operation does the right thing at runtime. Working from the CLI and execution logs alone, the pipeline looks entirely green.

```xml
<!-- BROKEN — names a customTypeId the descriptor never declares -->
<GenericOperationConfig customOperationType="EXECUTE" objectTypeId="CurrentWeather" operationType="EXECUTE">

<!-- CORRECT — base operation type only -->
<GenericOperationConfig objectTypeId="CurrentWeather" objectTypeName="Current Weather" operationType="EXECUTE">
```

### The Rule

Omit `customOperationType` entirely unless the connector descriptor declares a `customTypeId` on that operation. Author the component's attributes from the descriptor, not by copying another connector's pulled operation — a working component from a *different* connector may legitimately carry a `customOperationType` backed by its own descriptor.

### Related

`customOperationType` is not the only attribute the platform accepts without checking. A wrong `objectTypeId` behaves the same way at runtime — silent, successful, correct output — and a wrong `<field id>` is worse still (Issue #37).

### Detection

There is no CLI check. Open the operation component in the Integration GUI, or verify the attributes against the connector descriptor before pushing. The connector descriptor validator inspects the descriptor only and has no visibility into components.

The connector itself is the one component positioned to notice: the platform passes the unresolvable value through untouched, so a connector that validates `getCustomOperationType()` against its own known set and throws `ConnectorException` on a miss turns this GUI-only defect into a loud runtime failure.

### Fixing It

**The Connector Action dropdown is disabled on an existing operation component.** An operation is bound to the action chosen when it was created, so this cannot be repaired in the GUI — either correct `customOperationType` in the component XML and push, or create a replacement operation from the canvas and repoint the step at it.

The same collapse hits every existing operation component for a connector whose descriptor **newly names** a previously-unnamed operation: those components carry no `customOperationType`, so they no longer match a declared operation. Activating such a connector version breaks consumers at design time with no warning, while their integrations keep running. Connector authors should name operations from the first published version.

## Issue #37: Operation Field Silently Ignored While the GUI Shows the Descriptor Default

**Frequency:** High (any hand-authored custom connector operation)
**Detection:** No automatic detection. Every available diagnostic reports health, including the GUI.

### The Problem

A `<field id="…">` in a custom connector Operation component that does not match a descriptor-declared id still reaches the connector — under the wrong name. The platform does not filter operation properties against the descriptor, so the misnamed key is delivered verbatim and the id the connector actually reads is simply absent. Nothing replaces it: the descriptor's `<defaultValue>` is **not** applied at runtime, so the connector falls back to whatever its own code does with a missing value.

A one-character typo is enough. With `latitide` for `latitude`: the push succeeds, the deploy succeeds, execution reports COMPLETE, and a well-formed document comes back containing plausible data for entirely the wrong input.

**The GUI actively reassures you.** Opening that component shows the field populated with the descriptor's `<defaultValue>` — a value the stored XML does not contain and the runtime never sends. `<defaultValue>` is a design-time pre-fill only, so design time and runtime disagree and the reassuring surface is the GUI. There is no warning banner, unlike Issue #36.

Worse, because the GUI renders that default into a real form field, opening and saving the component writes the default into the XML — silently "fixing" it to a value the author never chose.

### Detection

Only two things work:

- Diff the component's `<field id>` values against the descriptor's `<operation>` field ids, character by character.
- Log `getOperationProperties().keySet()` from the connector. The platform delivers undeclared ids through untouched, so the received key set is the ground truth — an unexpected key or a missing expected one is the signal.

An *extra* undeclared field alongside the correct one is harmless for a connector that reads fields by name, but a connector enumerating properties generically must filter them itself.

### The Fix

Correct the `<field id>` in the component XML to match the descriptor and push. There is no GUI repair path: the GUI never showed the misnamed field, and opening the component writes the descriptor default into the XML — replacing the intended value with one the author never chose and erasing the evidence of the typo.

## Issue #38: Operation `subType` Silently Selects a Different Connector Build

**Frequency:** Medium (any account with more than one classification on a connector)
**Detection:** Silent. One log prefix and one small GUI subtitle.

### The Problem

On a custom connector Operation component, `subType` is not merely metadata that ought to agree with the connection — **it selects which connector classification, and therefore which connector version, executes.** The Connection component contributes only its field values.

A mismatch between the operation's `subType` and the connection's is accepted on push, on deploy, and at execution, with correct-looking output. In normal use — `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` classifications carrying different connector versions — the result is that the runtime loads a different connector build than the connection belongs to, with the connection's credentials, and reports nothing.

This is easy to do by accident: each classification appears in the Integration connector picker as its own separately selectable connector, with a near-identical display name.

### Detection

- **Process log.** The connector step logs `<connection name>: <classificationType> Connector; <operation name>`. Compare that classificationType against the connection component's `subType` — this is the only CLI-visible signal.
- **GUI.** A small grey label beside the component name names the connector the component belongs to. Comparing that label on the connection and on the operation is the only design-time check, and nothing draws attention to a discrepancy.

### The Fix

Set the operation component's `subType` to the same `classificationType` as the connection's and push. Check the log prefix on the next execution to confirm the intended classification ran.

## Issue #39: Pushing a Pulled Connection Destroys the Password

**Frequency:** High for REST Client and custom SDK connector connections edited by pull-then-push
**Detection:** Silent at design time — surfaces only as an authentication rejection from the target system.

This is the canonical description of the hazard. `rest_connection_component.md` § Password Encryption and `custom_connector_connection_component.md` § Password Handling cover what is specific to each.

### The Problem

`type="password"` fields are **write-only**. A pull returns a 128-character lowercase-hex token — a reference to the stored secret, not the password — and every push stores the field's `value` verbatim as the new secret. Preserving that hex string byte for byte therefore makes the hex string itself the credential, and the connector presents 128 characters of hex where the password should be.

`isSet="true"` in `<bns:encryptedValues>` does not protect the value; it is display metadata meaning "at least one password-typed field is set", not which. Every form of the field other than a plaintext value destroys the credential:

| Pushed `value` | Stored result | Visible in a later pull? |
|---|---|---|
| the pulled 128-hex token | the token string becomes the password | **No** — entry stays `isSet="true"`, looks healthy |
| a truncated or altered token | that string becomes the password | **No** — same |
| `""` (empty) over a set secret | cleared | Yes — `<bns:encryptedValues/>` comes back empty |
| field omitted | field deleted | Yes — field absent from the pulled XML |

Push, deploy, and execution all succeed. Only the remote system rejects the credential.

The push-time guard is narrower than the hazard: `boomi-component-push.sh` and `boomi-component-create.sh` reject a pushed 128-hex token for REST Client components only. A custom SDK connector connection (`type="connector-settings"`) carrying the same token pushes without complaint.

### The Fix

Have the user re-enter the password in the GUI. Author the field as `value=""` and have them fill it in afterward, re-inserting the field first if it was deleted. Do not ask the user for the plaintext to work around this.

For **REST connections**, moving the secret to Environment Extensions makes the component XML safe to pull, edit, and push freely — see `rest_connection_component.md` § Keeping the Password Out of the Component. That path is not established for custom connector connection fields; there, the GUI is the only remedy.

Re-pulling and re-pushing only stores a fresh token. A successful push says nothing about credential validity — only executing against the target system confirms it.

## Issue #40: Component GUID in a Script Body Creates No Dependency Edge

**Frequency:** High (any script reading a Process Property component by GUID)
**Detection:** Runtime error — push and deploy both complete cleanly, with no warning

### The Problem

A component GUID written as a string literal inside a script body is opaque text to the platform's reference analysis. No dependency edge is formed, so the referenced component is **not packaged** with the process at deploy time. If no other reference in the process pulls it into the package, execution fails:

```
Error executing data process
Caused by: com.boomi.process.ProcessException: Component does not exist:
{PROCESS_PROPERTY_COMPONENT_ID} (in groovy2 script)
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Component does not exist:
{PROCESS_PROPERTY_COMPONENT_ID}
```

The canonical case is `ExecutionUtil.getProcessProperty(componentId, key)` in a Data Process step. Push returns success, `boomi-deploy.sh` reports success, and the failure is deferred to the first execution.

### Why It Happens

`ExecutionUtil.getProcessProperty` resolves the Process Property component out of the **deployed package** at execution time. Package contents are computed from the structured references in the process XML — shape attributes, parameter values, profile and map references. A GUID inside `<script>` text is never parsed as one of those, so the component never enters the package and the runtime lookup has nothing to load.

This is a packaging failure, not a scripting failure. The script is syntactically fine and the GUID is correct; the component simply is not there.

### Wrong Pattern — Script Is the Only Reference

The GUID appears exactly once in the process XML, inside the script body:

```groovy
String targetUrl = ExecutionUtil.getProcessProperty(
    "{PROCESS_PROPERTY_COMPONENT_ID}", "prop-target-url");
```

Querying the process component's references returns nothing, and the deployed package contains only the process:

```
Found 0 reference(s) (references: 0, referenced-by: 0)
```

### Correct Pattern — Read Into a DPP With a Set Properties Step

A Set Properties step using `valueType="definedparameter"` is a structured reference. It creates the edge, packages the component, and puts the value in a DPP that scripts can read without naming any GUID:

```xml
<parametervalue key="1" valueType="definedparameter">
  <definedprocessparameter componentId="{PROCESS_PROPERTY_COMPONENT_ID}"
                           componentName="API Settings"
                           propertyKey="prop-target-url"
                           propertyLabel="API Base URL"/>
</parametervalue>
```

```groovy
String targetUrl = ExecutionUtil.getDynamicProcessProperty("DPP_TARGET_URL");
```

The reference query then reports the edge, the deployed package carries both components, and a direct `getProcessProperty` call in the same process resolves.

### The Rule

A script may only reach a component that something else in the process already references structurally. When a script must call `getProcessProperty` or `setProcessProperty` directly — writing values back, or choosing the property key at execution time — keep at least one Set Properties step reading that component so it stays packaged.

## Issue #41: A Map With No Satisfied Mapping Emits Zero Documents

**Frequency:** High (any map whose source data may not match the source profile in every mapped position)
**Detection:** Explicit ERROR at the map step — zero documents emitted, every downstream step skipped.

Issues #26 and #34 are two specific causes of this error. This is the general case.

### The Problem

A map produces output only for the mappings the source data actually satisfies. When **no** mapping in the map is satisfied, the map emits **zero documents** rather than an empty one, and the map step fails:

```
No data produced from map '<name>', please check source profile and make sure it matches source data.
```

The process logs a document error and every downstream step is skipped. Through a web service listener this surfaces as HTTP 500.

The message's advice is accurate — the source data does not match the source profile in any mapped position. The trap is the assumption that a map with nothing to write produces an empty document. It produces no document.

### The Rule

**One satisfied mapping keeps the document alive.** A map containing a mapping the data always satisfies emits a document even when every other mapping comes up empty — the unsatisfied target fields are simply absent from the output. Where a map has a single data path and that path can be missing, the failure is total rather than partial.

The distinction is presence, not value. A present source element with an empty value satisfies its mapping and keeps the document alive; an absent source element does not. So the same map can return a valid near-empty document for one input and fail outright for another that differs only by a missing key.

Guard a map whose only mapping can come up empty by adding a second mapping from a source element that is always present.

### Known specific causes

| Cause | Where |
|---|---|
| The map's only mapping feeds a Set function — the side effect does not count as output | `components/map_component_functions.md` |
| UDF interface drift after removing or renumbering a key | `components/user_defined_function_component.md` |
| Identity-value trimming in a data positioned profile, when the unmatched record is the only record | Issue #26 |
| Profile-keyed access after a Split Documents step, which preserves the parent wrapper | Issue #34 |

## Issue #42: Missing `key` on a Set Properties `<parametervalue>` Makes the Shape Un-editable

**Frequency:** High (any Set Properties shape authored programmatically rather than round-tripped through the GUI)
**Detection:** GUI only — push, validation, versioning, deploy and execution all succeed.

### The Problem

A Set Properties (`documentproperties`) shape whose `<sourcevalues>` contains a `<parametervalue>` with no `key` attribute is un-editable in the platform UI. The shape still draws on the canvas; double-clicking it silently does nothing. No validation error, no warning, no request-time symptom — the process executes correctly. The defect is invisible until a human tries to edit the shape, and the only recovery is to repair the XML and re-push. A process that sets properties in many shapes can be almost entirely un-editable.

**Scope.** This entry covers the top-level `<parametervalue>` elements of a Set Properties `<sourcevalues>` group. `<parametervalue>` in any other context — connector-step `<parameters>`, Message and Notify placeholders, the nested `<inputs>` of a lookup source value — is out of scope here.

### Why It Happens

`key` is a design-time identifier the configuration editor requires in order to render the parameter rows. It is ignored at request time — substitution and concatenation follow XML element order, never `key` — which is why omitting it produces no request-time symptom.

The GUI stamps `key` on every source value it authors, so a keyless one is in practice agent-authored.

### Wrong Pattern — Shape Cannot Be Opened

```xml
<sourcevalues>
  <!-- no key attribute -->
  <parametervalue valueType="static">
    <staticparameter staticproperty="hello"/>
  </parametervalue>
</sourcevalues>
<!-- Result: pushes, validates, versions and executes correctly; the Set Properties
     dialog silently never opens and the shape is read-only in the GUI -->
```

### Correct Pattern — Dialog Opens

```xml
<sourcevalues>
  <parametervalue key="0" valueType="static">
    <staticparameter staticproperty="hello"/>
  </parametervalue>
</sourcevalues>
<!-- Result: pushes, executes AND opens in the GUI -->
```

### The Rule

**Emit `key` on every Set Properties source value** — a 0-based sequence over the top-level source values of each `<sourcevalues>` group, restarting at `0` per group. This matches what the GUI itself writes: adding a third source value to a group of two yields `key="2"`, and a sibling `<sourcevalues>` group in the same shape stays at `0,1` rather than shifting. Gaps are harmless; absence is not.

Because the platform substitutes parameters by element order and never by `key`, adding a missing `key` is **inert at request time**: preserve element order and the repair changes no behavior, so it needs no redeploy — only a re-push and a page reload.

**Opening and saving the process in the GUI does not repair it.** The editor assigns `key` only to elements it creates and leaves every untouched shape byte-identical — it does not back-fill keys elsewhere in the process. A keyless shape stays keyless until corrected XML is pushed, and since the shape cannot be opened in the first place, there is no GUI-only recovery path.

### Detection

Scan any process XML before pushing it. Scope the scan to `<sourcevalues>` so `<parametervalue>` in other contexts isn't flagged:

```bash
awk '/<sourcevalues>/{s=1} s && /<parametervalue/ && !/key=/{print FNR": "$0} /<\/sourcevalues>/{s=0}' process.xml
```

Any output is a defect. The reset trails the check so a `<sourcevalues>` group closed on its own opening line is still scanned. Two formatting limits: on single-line XML one `key=` anywhere on the line suppresses every match, and a `<parametervalue` whose attributes wrap onto a continuation line reports as a defect even when `key` is present on the next line. Format the document one element per line before scanning it.

## Issue #43: Unwired Output Path on a Shape That Emits Documents

**Frequency:** High (any process authored programmatically whose last shape is not a designated terminal)
**Detection:** Runtime error — push and deploy both clean. Silent on a multi-path shape.

### The Problem

An empty `<dragpoints/>` declares no outgoing connections. That is only correct on the four shapes that never pass documents to a downstream shape: **Stop, Exception, Return Documents, Add to Cache**. On any other shape the process pushes and deploys with no error or warning, and the defect surfaces only when the process runs.

A shape that emits documents downstream — Message, Set Properties, Data Process, Notify — fails on its first execution:

```
SEVERE  <step label>  Unexpected error executing process: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
	at java.base/java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableList.get(Collections.java:1310)
	at com.boomi.process.graph.ProcessShape.getNextWriteStore(ProcessShape.java:486)
	at com.boomi.process.shape.MessageShape.execute(MessageShape.java:52)
```

Only the last frame varies by shape — `DocumentPropertyShape.execute`, `DataProcessShape.execute`, `NotifyShape.execute`. The failure precedes the step's own work: a Notify in this state writes none of its usual log lines, and a Data Process logs no execution result.

A **Map** fails on the same condition but reports it as a document error, with no stack trace:

```
INFO     Executing Map with 1 document(s).
INFO     Shape executed with errors in 69 ms.
WARNING  <process name> encountered 1 document error(s)
SEVERE   First document failure: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
```

Searching logs for `IndexOutOfBoundsException` does not find the Map case — the message appears without the Java class name.

A **Branch** does not fail at all. It executes, reports success, and the process completes normally with every declared branch silently dropped. A `numBranches="2"` Branch with empty `<dragpoints/>` is indistinguishable at push, deploy and execution time from a correctly wired one.

#### The partially-unwired variant

On a Decision or Try/Catch, a shape with *some* paths wired and one left unwired behaves the same way the Branch does: nothing fails. The document routed down the unwired path is **discarded** and the execution reports COMPLETE with no error. `toShape="unset"`, a typo'd target, and an omitted `<dragpoint>` are equivalent here — see `BOOMI_THINKING.md` § Dragpoints and Output Path Wiring for the authoring rule.

**How silent it is depends on the shape:**

- **Decision, Branch** — nothing in the log at all. The shape reports `Shape executed successfully` and the next line is `Process execution completed normally.`
- **Try/Catch** — the engine still logs `WARNING  Try/Catch Shape sending 1 document(s) down error path`, with no catch-path shape activity after it. That orphaned warning is the only signal an unwired path gives at execution.

### Why It Happens

A shape that produces output asks the process graph for the document store to write into. `getNextWriteStore` indexes position 0 of that list; with no dragpoints the list is empty and the lookup throws. Nothing about this is specific to one shape type — the shared frame is the same in every case, and only the calling shape class differs.

A Branch instead iterates its dragpoint list. An empty list means zero iterations: nothing to write, no exception, and no branch executed.

### Wrong Pattern — Deploys Clean, Fails at Execution

```xml
<shape name="shape3" shapetype="message">
  <configuration><message>...</message></configuration>
  <dragpoints/>
</shape>
<!-- Result: push SUCCESS, deploy SUCCESS, first execution ERROR -->
```

### Correct Pattern — Wired to a Terminal

```xml
<shape name="shape3" shapetype="message">
  <configuration><message>...</message></configuration>
  <dragpoints>
    <dragpoint name="shape4" toShape="shape4"/>
  </dragpoints>
</shape>
<shape name="shape4" shapetype="stop">
  <configuration><stop continue="true"/></configuration>
  <dragpoints/>
</shape>
```

### The Rule

**End every path at Stop, Exception, Return Documents, or Add to Cache.** Any other shape needs a wired path, and a Stop step is always a legal target.

Surviving execution is not the test — a Branch survives it. Wire the path regardless: a Stop communicates an intended stopping point, while a dangling shape reads as an oversight and, on a multi-path shape, hides a dropped branch.

Where a shape has several outcomes, each needs its own target — see `BOOMI_THINKING.md` § Converging Outcomes for why they must not share one.

### Detection

Scan process XML before pushing it. Two distinct defects to find.

**A shape with no outcomes at all** — an empty `<dragpoints/>` whose `shapetype` is not one of the four terminals:

```bash
awk 'match($0,/shapetype="[^"]+"/){t=substr($0,RSTART+11,RLENGTH-12)} /<dragpoints\/>/{if(t!~/^(stop|exception|returndocuments|doccacheload)$/)print FNR": "t}' process.xml
```

Any output is a defect. Two formatting limits: the shape's `shapetype` must appear on an earlier line than its `<dragpoints/>`, and an empty element written `<dragpoints></dragpoints>` or `<dragpoints />` is not matched. Format the document one element per line before scanning it.

**A multi-path shape with one outcome that resolves to nothing** — `toShape="unset"`, a typo'd target, or a `<dragpoint>` omitted entirely. No string search catches all three, so check the converse: every outcome a multi-path shape declares must resolve to a `<shape name="...">` in the same process, and the shape must declare every outcome its `shapetype` carries. For Decision and Branch this static check is the only detection available. On a Trading Partner Start the `identifier` must additionally be one of `documents`, `acknowledgements`, `errors`, `archive` — any other value is inert even though its `toShape` resolves; see `steps/trading_partner_steps.md`.

## Issue #44: EDI Segments Outside a Root Container Make the Profile Uneditable

**Frequency:** High (any EDI profile authored programmatically rather than built through the import wizard)
**Detection:** GUI only — push, deploy and execution all succeed; the Data Elements tab renders as never-configured.

### The Problem

An EDI profile whose `EdiSegment` nodes are direct children of `<DataElements>` — with no enclosing `EdiLoop isContainer="true"` — renders as an empty, never-configured profile, and any map using it shows a blank pane on that profile's side. A JSON/XML profile opposite renders fine, so the fault is the EDI profile tree renderer, not the map editor.

Push, deploy and execution all succeed and the data parses. The component is not corrupt, it is **uneditable**.

### Why It Is Worse Than It Looks

- Opening the unrenderable profile presents an **import wizard**; completing it overwrites the component.
- A map against such a profile cannot be safely round-tripped through the editor. Regeneration preserves only what renders, dropping every mapping that references the unrenderable side; the result executes, emitting function-fed and default values only, and looks exactly like a mapping bug.

### The Rule

**Every `EdiSegment` nests inside an `EdiLoop` with `isContainer="true"`, under every standard.** Root container naming is free; a single loop is enough.

### Repair

Wrap the existing segments in a root container **without renumbering any `EdiDataElement` key** — element keys are what `fromKey` references resolve against. Segment and loop keys are safe to change; mappings do not reference them. Then pull the map with `boomi-component-pull.sh` and confirm it still carries its full set of mappings before pushing over it (see `references/components/map_component.md` § Regenerating a Mappings Block Is Destructive).

## Issue #45: Unresolvable `tagLists` `elementKey` Destroys Every Document

**Frequency:** Medium (any EDI profile whose `tagLists` `elementKey` values are hand-authored or renumbered)
**Detection:** Runtime ERROR — zero documents, error blames the source data.

### The Problem

A `TagList` whose `elementKey` names a key that does not exist in the profile is accepted on push, stored verbatim, deploys cleanly, and renders without complaint. At execution the map emits **zero documents** and the process fails:

```
First document failure: No data produced from map '<map name>',
                        please check source profile and make sure it matches source data.
```

Not an empty document — nothing at all. Downstream steps are skipped.

### Why It Is Hard to Diagnose

The error names the source data, which is the wrong place to look. Two profiles differing only in `elementKey` have byte-identical `DataElements` and push and deploy identically; one routes correctly, the other destroys the document.

```xml
<TagList elementKey="90" listKey="1">   <!-- REF_Loop is key 90 — resolves -->
<TagList elementKey="95" listKey="1">   <!-- no node has key 95 — zero documents -->
```

### The Rule

**When a map produces no data and its source profile has `tagLists`, confirm every `elementKey` resolves to a key in that profile before investigating the payload.**

## Issue #46: Flat File Split Documents Misconfiguration

**Frequency:** High (any flat file split whose mode or headers were set in the GUI, or left implicit)
**Detection:** Runtime error on a missing link element. Silent row loss on headers — or an ERROR naming the map.

### The Problem

Two independent defects, both surviving push, deploy and a GUI save:

**No link element.** `splitOption` absent falls back to `split_profile`, not `split_line`. Without `profileId`, `linkElementKey` and `linkElementName` the step fails when a document reaches it:

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The Link Element was not selected for a Split Documents By Profile processing step.
```

Two ordinary GUI actions reach that config with no warning: switching `Split Options` to `Split By Profile` and saving with the pickers unset, and a `Split By Profile` → `Split By Line` → `Split By Profile` round trip, which clears both pickers and turns a working shape into a failing one.

**Headers dropped.** A downstream step parsing split output against a `useColumnHeaders="true"` profile consumes each document's first line as a header. Unless `headersOption="retain"` re-emits the header, that line is a data row and it is lost — silently, at COMPLETE. A document left with zero data rows fails the map instead, and no documents reach the next step:

```
No data produced from map '<map name>', please check source profile and
make sure it matches source data.
```

The error names the map and its source profile. Both are correct; the split upstream is the cause, and `headersOption` is never mentioned.

### The Rule

**Always write `splitOption` explicitly, with all three profile attributes when it is `split_profile`. Where a downstream step parses the output against a `useColumnHeaders="true"` profile, `headersOption="retain"` is the only correct value.** For the per-sub-mode breakdown of both settings, see `references/steps/data_process_step.md` § Flat File.
