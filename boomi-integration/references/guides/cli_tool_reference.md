### CLI Tools

Specialized bash tools handle different aspects of the development lifecycle. All tools require `curl` and `jq`, and source credentials directly from `.env` — no Python dependencies or virtual environments needed. Run `boomi-env-check.sh` to see which required tools are installed.

**Environment & Setup**:
- **boomi-env-check.sh**: Check which `.env` variables are set without revealing values, and which required CLI tools are installed
- **boomi-folder-create.sh**: Create new folders for project organization. Falls back to account root if `BOOMI_TARGET_FOLDER` is invalid or missing — do not attempt to manually search or resolve parent folders if absent. If the fallback WARN fires, tell the user their configured target folder was not used and confirm the correct folder ID.
- **boomi-shared-server-info.sh**: Fetch atom `apiType`, default-port `url`, default-port `auth` (when reportable), and atom-wide `minAuth` floor from `SharedServerInformation`. Run before authoring any WSS listener or API Service Component to route by API tier (`basic`/`intermediate` → bare WSS; `advanced` → API Service Component). Takes an atom ID as arg; defaults to `$BOOMI_TEST_ATOM_ID`. Exits non-zero on lookup failure. Output is supplementary — see `references/platform_entities/shared_web_server.md` for what the API can and can't tell you about a multi-port atom.

**Component Management** (all support `--branch <name_or_id>` for Branch & Merge accounts):
- **boomi-component-create.sh**: Create new components on platform (generates component IDs)
- **boomi-component-push.sh**: Update existing components on platform
- **boomi-component-pull.sh**: Download components from platform to local
- **boomi-component-diff.sh**: Compare two versions of a component (structured JSON diff)
- **boomi-version-history.sh**: List component version history
- **boomi-component-search.sh**: Query components by folder, name, type, or reference relationship. Writes JSON to `active-development/inventories/component_search_<timestamp>.json`. Folder scoping is flat unless `--recursive`; `--folder` accepts an id, exact name, `%` pattern, or path. `--related-to` cannot combine with other filters. Implicit filters: `currentVersion=true`, `deleted=false` — which scopes results to the account default branch.
- **boomi-folder-list.sh**: List a folder's child folders (or its whole subtree with `--recursive`) as `id<TAB>fullPath`, also written to `active-development/inventories/folder_list_<timestamp>.json`.

**Deployment & Testing**:
- **boomi-deploy.sh**: Deploy processes to runtime environments
- **boomi-undeploy.sh**: Remove deployments by ID or by component file (`--by-component`)
- **boomi-test-execute.sh**: Trigger process execution via platform API and return execution ID
- **boomi-wss-test.sh**: Test WSS listener endpoints directly via the shared web server
- **boomi-execution-query.sh**: Query execution records and download logs for any process type (including WSS listeners, manually executed processes, scheduled processes). `--logs` also requires `unzip`, since logs arrive as a zip archive; it exits non-zero with a diagnostic when `unzip` is absent or the log cannot be extracted, rather than reporting an empty log.

**Branch & Merge** (only for accounts with Branch & Merge enabled):
- **boomi-branch.sh**: Branch lifecycle and merge request operations (subcommand-based)

**Profile Analysis**:
- **boomi-profile-inspect.py**: Extract field metadata from large profiles (XML, EDI, Flat File) — Python stdlib only, no pip deps

**Tool Selection Guide & Decision Tree**:

**Basic Decision Logic**:
- **No sync state file exists** → Use CREATE tools
- **Sync state file exists** → Use UPDATE (push/pull) tools
- **Building from scratch** → The agent orchestrates individual component creation
- **Modifying existing** → Use individual push/pull tools

**New Components (CREATE workflow)**:
```bash
# STEP 1: Create dedicated project folder (run from workspace)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-folder-create.sh "WeatherAPI_Project"
# Returns: folder_abc123def

# STEP 2: Create components (XML must have folderId="folder_abc123def" attribute)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-create.sh active-development/<profile-type>/new-profile.xml  # <profile-type> is profile.json, profile.xml, profile.edi, etc.
```

**Existing Components (UPDATE workflow)**:
```bash
# Push (design-time update)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh active-development/process/my-process.xml

# Pull from platform
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-pull.sh --component-id <guid>

# Deploy to runtime (REQUIRED before testing)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh active-development/process/my-process.xml --deployment-notes "Optional notes"

# Execute process tests via platform API
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-test-execute.sh --process-id <guid>

# Test WSS listener endpoint via shared web server
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-wss-test.sh --path /ws/simple/createOrder --method POST --data '{"key":"value"}'

# List environments
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh --list-environments

# Undeploy by component file
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-undeploy.sh --by-component active-development/process/my-process.xml

# Undeploy by deployment ID
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-undeploy.sh <deploymentId>

# Query recent executions (last 3 by default, all filters optional)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-execution-query.sh [--process-id <guid>] [--status STATUS] [--since ISO8601] [--limit N]

# Download logs for a specific execution
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-execution-query.sh --execution-id <execution-id> --logs
```

**Component Search** (discovery primitive — results land in `active-development/inventories/<timestamp>.json` for later reference):
```bash
# Components directly in a folder (flat by default). --folder takes an id, exact
# name, % pattern, or path; multiple matches are unioned.
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --folder "AcmeCorp-EmailNotification"

# The folder AND its subfolders. An organizational parent returns 0 components when
# searched flat, and a % pattern on its name will not reach its children.
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --folder "%Invoicing%" --recursive

# A path disambiguates same-named folders; a '/'-anchored trailing portion is
# enough, and % works in any segment.
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --folder "Billing/Invoic%" --type process

# All connections in an account — the API-level type is connector-settings.
# To narrow to a specific connector, filter the saved JSON by subType
# (e.g. "salesforce", "http", "db") with jq after the search completes.
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --type connector-settings

# Processes with "Invoice" in the name (LIKE is case-insensitive)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --name '%Invoice%' --type process

# Multiple types in one query (OR semantics)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --type connector-settings,connector-action

# What references this component (and what does it reference)? Each record has a `relation` field
# ("references" or "referenced-by") to distinguish direction.
# IMPORTANT: --related-to cannot be combined with other filters.
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-search.sh --related-to <componentId>
```

**Folder Discovery** (structure under a parent folder):
```bash
# Account's top-level folders
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-folder-list.sh

# A folder's direct children; add --recursive for the whole subtree
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-folder-list.sh --folder "%Invoicing%"
```

Deleted folders are excluded from every folder query. A `--recursive` scope is capped at
`FOLDER_SCOPE_MAX` folders (default 1000); past it both tools print `TRUNCATED` and set
`metadata.truncated`.

`boomi-folder-list.sh` omits the named folder from its output; `boomi-component-search.sh
--recursive` includes it in scope. Component records carry `folderId` and `folderName` but no path,
so when same-named folders are in scope, attribute records via `metadata.filters.folderScope`
(id + `fullPath`), not `folderName`.

**`--type` takes the API-level component type, not the Boomi UI label.** A Boomi "connection" is `connector-settings` (with a `subType` naming the connector); an "operation" is `connector-action`. Other common types: `process`, `transform.map`, `profile.xml`, `profile.json`, `profile.db`, `profile.edi`, `profile.flatfile`, `script.processing`, `webservice`, `flowservice`, `queue`.

Dependency walking: to list all dependencies of a process, call `--related-to <processId>` to find immediate references, then pull any you want to inspect via `boomi-component-pull.sh` and read their `<bns:object>` / `<componentReferences>` for deeper recursion.

**Branch Workflows** (only when user has explicitly opted into Branch & Merge):
```bash
# Branch lifecycle
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh list
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh create --name feature-x --parent main
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh delete --branch feature-x

# Component operations on a branch
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-pull.sh --component-id <guid> --branch feature-x
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-create.sh active-development/process/new-process.xml --branch feature-x
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-push.sh active-development/process/my-process.xml  # branch is sticky from XML

# Merge operations
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh merge --source feature-x --dest <target-branch>
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh merge-status --id <mergeRequestId>   # poll until stage=REVIEWING
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-branch.sh merge-execute --id <mergeRequestId>  # execute the merge

# Deploy from a branch directly — no merge to main needed
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-deploy.sh active-development/process/my-process.xml
```

**Branch resolution priority for component tools:** `--branch` flag > `branchId` already in XML > `BOOMI_DEFAULT_BRANCH_ID` env var > the *account default branch* (main unless the account sets another). Pass `--branch main` to target main from an account whose default is elsewhere.

**Safety:** Push aborts if sync state records a branch but the XML has no `branchId` — pass `--branch`, or `--account-default` to push unqualified on purpose. Deploy replaces any existing deployment of the process in the target environment, on every branch including main. On `ComponentId is invalid`, pull and push automatically query `ComponentMetadata` and print a `DIAGNOSIS:` line naming the branches that hold the component, because the platform's response is identical to a nonexistent ID.

**Reading the account default branch:** `boomi-branch.sh default` — read-only.

See `references/guides/branch_merge_guide.md` for full Branch & Merge API reference.

**Version Management Workflows**:
```bash
# List all versions of a component (rows from every branch)
# Also writes the full result set to active-development/inventories/version_history_<ts>.json
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-version-history.sh --component-id <guid>

# Pull a specific historical version (saves as MyProcess_v2.xml)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-pull.sh --component-id <guid> --version 2

# Compare two versions
bash <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-component-diff.sh --component-id <guid> --source 1 --target 3
```

See `references/guides/version_management_guide.md` for full version management reference.

**Push short-circuit:** `boomi-component-push.sh` compares the local file's hash against the hash recorded in local sync state, not against the platform. If the component changed in the GUI but the local file did not, the push reports `matches the last push — nothing sent to the platform` and sends nothing, so GUI-side drift is invisible to it. Use `--force` to overwrite platform state from the local file. The target branch is part of the comparison, so a push that retargets the branch (`--branch`, `--account-default`) still goes out on byte-identical content.

**Diff blind spot:** `boomi-component-diff.sh` does not report dragpoint `x`/`y` changes — the platform's diff omits cosmetic coordinates. A GUI save that regenerates dragpoint coordinates shows up as a diff of only the label attributes it also changed. To detect that kind of drift, pull both versions and compare the XML directly.

**Large Profile Analysis**:
```bash
# Generate searchable field inventory (writes distilled_<name>.json next to the source profile XML)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/boomi-profile-inspect.py active-development/<profile-type>/large-profile.xml
```

**When to use**: Run this tool immediately when attempting to Read a profile file and encountering a "file too large" error. The tool extracts element IDs with full hierarchical paths, enabling disambiguation of duplicate field names common in WSDL/SOAP-derived profiles (e.g., 60+ "First_Name" fields in different contexts).

**Supported profile types**: XML, EDI, and Flat File profiles. EDI output includes `purpose` field with semantic context.

**Workflow after running**:
1. Tool writes pretty-printed JSON to `distilled_<ProfileName>.json` in the same folder as the source profile XML
2. Use Read or Grep to search the distilled file for field keys, paths, and types
3. If field comments are needed, grep the original profile by the field's `key` attribute

All tools use exception-based error handling and essential functionality only.

### XML Format Requirements for New Components

**Required Structure for CREATE operations**:
```xml
<bns:Component componentId=""
               name="Component_Name"
               type="component-type"
               folderId="{FOLDER_GUID}">
  <bns:encryptedValues/>
  <bns:object>
    <!-- Component-specific configuration -->
  </bns:object>
</bns:Component>
```

**Common CREATE Mistakes**:
- Including non-empty `componentId` (causes validation errors - platform generates this)
- Missing `bns:encryptedValues` element (required but can be empty)
- WRONG: `folderId=""` (empty causes root folder placement)
- WRONG: `folderId="{FOLDER_GUID}"` (literal placeholder text fails)
- CORRECT: `folderId="folder_abc123def"` (actual resolved GUID)

**Common Schema Errors**:
- Message step: Using `combineDocuments`/`messageType` attributes (don't exist)
- Stop step: Using `<stopaction/>` instead of `<stop continue="true"/>`
- Connector step: Wrong `connectionId`/`operationId` format (must be GUIDs)
- Set Properties: Using `shapetype="setproperties"` instead of `shapetype="documentproperties"`

### Sync State Structure

Components track synchronization state in `.sync-state/{component-type}_{component-name}.json`. The filename is derived from the component's path relative to `active-development/` (e.g., `process/My Process.xml` → `.sync-state/process_My Process.json`). This prevents name collisions when different component types share the same name (e.g., a process and its operation both named "WSS Fetch EOQ Opps").

```json
{
  "component_id": "generated-guid-from-platform",
  "file_path": "path/to/local/file.xml",
  "content_hash": "sha256-hash",
  "last_sync": "2025-09-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Backward compatibility**: Tools check for the new path-based state file first, then fall back to legacy stem-only files (`{component-name}.json`). Existing projects continue to work without migration.

**Sync state presence drives tool selection**: No file → CREATE, file exists → UPDATE

### Error Recovery Strategies

**Push failures**:
- Read error message for specific XML validation issues
- Fix component XML structure
- Retry push operation

**Reference resolution failures**:
- Verify component ID exists in `.sync-state/` directory
- Check that referenced component was successfully created
- Confirm GUID matches between reference and sync state

**Schema validation failures**:
- Compare XML structure against examples in `references/components/` or `references/steps/`
- Check shapetype matches step type (common mismatch: Set Properties)
- Verify all required attributes present

**Folder placement issues**:
- Check GUI immediately after creation to confirm proper folder placement
- If component landed in root: Verify `BOOMI_TARGET_FOLDER` environment variable
- Delete and recreate component with correct folder ID if misplaced

### Component Type & Folder Convention

**Folder rule:** Components live in `active-development/<component-type>/`, where `<component-type>` is the platform's component-type identifier (lowercase, verbatim — matches the component XML's `type=` attribute). Folders are created on demand by `boomi-component-pull.sh`; on the create-from-scratch path, `mkdir -p` the type folder yourself before writing the XML.

**File rule:** Component definitions are always XML files (`.xml`), regardless of sub-type. A JSON profile is `<MyProfile>.xml` inside `active-development/profile.json/` — the folder names the type, the file extension reflects how Boomi stores it.

**UI label ↔ component-type identifier** (only the cases where they diverge — for everything else, the identifier is the UI label lowercased with spaces removed: Process → `process`, Document Cache → `documentcache`, Trading Partner → `tradingpartner`, Flow Service → `flowservice`, etc.):

| UI label | Component-type identifier |
|---|---|
| Connection | `connector-settings` |
| Operation | `connector-action` |
| Map | `transform.map` |
| XML Profile | `profile.xml` |
| JSON Profile | `profile.json` |
| EDI Profile | `profile.edi` |
| Flat File Profile | `profile.flatfile` |
| Database Profile | `profile.db` |

When **creating** a component, use the component-type identifier in the XML's `type=` attribute and as the folder name. When **pulling**, the platform returns the type and the script routes accordingly.

### Configuration System
**Streamlined Configuration**:
- All configuration is sourced directly from the `.env` file — no YAML config layer. Tools read it in-shell at startup.

### Activity Logging

Opt-in JSONL log of script-level operations (component pulls, pushes, deployments, etc.). Disabled by default — set `BOOMI_COMPANION_LOG_ACTIVITY=1` in `.env` to enable. Records are appended to `.activity-log/activity.jsonl` (gitignored) in the workspace and are written locally only — never transmitted off-machine. Each record contains timestamp, skill version, workspace, operation, script, OS user, Boomi user, account ID, environment ID (when set), result, HTTP code, and operation-specific details.

### Credential Management in Component XML

**Connection Re-use (Recommended):** Before creating a new connection, consider the discovery workflow: check `preferred_connections.md` → ask user if they have a link or component ID → pull existing connection. This keeps credentials out of the conversation entirely. If no existing connection fits, the user can create one in the Boomi GUI, or provide credentials directly for the agent to create one.

**Preferred pattern — pull from platform**: The user shares a component URL or ID, you pull it down, and use the pre-encrypted credential values as-is.

**User-provided credentials**: If the user provides a credential value directly (e.g., "here's the API key, build this"), use it in component XML. If it appears to be a production secret, remind them of the pull-from-platform option — but respect their choice.

**Pulled components — encryption behavior** (REST Client connections are an exception — see below):
- If any field has `encrypted="true"` or `type="password"` with encrypted value, preserve the value exactly as-is
- Encrypted hex values may change across pull cycles due to platform-side re-encryption — this is expected, not corruption
- Some connectors (e.g., MCP Server) use `encrypted="true"` on `<properties>` elements within `customproperties` fields instead of `type="password"` — see the relevant connection component reference
- Do not attempt to encrypt or re-encrypt values programmatically — this will produce broken credentials
- Do not copy an encrypted value from one component into a different component — a transplanted ciphertext can push cleanly but fail to decrypt when the process executes (surfacing as an auth failure with no other symptom). To credential a new component, have the user set the value in the GUI on that component, then pull it

**Password fields are write-only**: a pulled `type="password"` value is a platform token, not the password, and writing it back silently breaks the credential — never re-push a pulled connection that has one. `boomi-component-create.sh` and `boomi-component-push.sh` refuse a pushed token for **REST Client components only** (`--allow-password-token` overrides); a custom SDK connector connection carrying the same token pushes unchallenged, so the rule is yours to enforce there. Read `references/guides/boomi_error_reference.md` Issue #39 before writing either.

**Process property passwords**: Prefer leaving `defaultValue` empty for `type="password"` fields and supplying real values via Environment Extensions. If a pulled component has a non-empty password `defaultValue`, let the user know — they may want to migrate to Environment Extensions.

**Avoid reciting credentials** in plans, summaries, or overviews — they could be visible during screen sharing. The user can always ask you to surface them if needed.

**Variable substitution**:
- `{ComponentName}` → **Local XML ONLY** (resolved by agent orchestration during creation)
- CLI tools perform NO variable substitution on XML component files
