## 1.0.26

- Corrected http_client_component.md: all five HttpSettings sub-blocks are required on create/update; omitting them breaks the component in the Build UI

## 1.0.25

- Document the OpenAPI connector connection and operation components


## 1.0.24

- Expand Map Function documentation; add coverage for all Lookup functions (Simple, Cross Reference, Document Cache, SQL)

## 1.0.17

- Fix create/push/deploy failing for components with bracketed names (e.g. `[System] Order Sync`)


## 1.0.16

- Fix component create to stamp the assigned componentId onto the root whether its attribute was empty, stale, or absent.
- Warn instead of reporting success when the componentId cannot be stamped into the local file.

## 1.0.15

- Require xpath on every connection/operation override field; a missing xpath silently inerts the override.
- Emit the complete canonical ConnectionOverride block from a platform pull rather than a hand-picked subset.
- Add error-reference Issue #31 (silently-inert override) with a grep detector; fix the inert <field> examples.


## 1.0.14

- Component push reports the resulting version number on success.
- Clarify the no-change skip message: nothing is sent; use `--force` to push anyway.
- Correct API troubleshooting guide: HTTP 403 is an authorization failure, not deduplication.


## 1.0.13

- Stream component create/push bodies from a tempfile to avoid ARG_MAX overflow on large processes


## 1.0.12

- Document process options and their effects


## 1.0.11

- CLI scripts now exit non-zero on API/operation failures, so callers detect failed pushes, creates, and deploys.
- `xml_attr` returns empty on no-match instead of aborting under `set -euo pipefail`, so missing-field guards print their diagnostics.


## 1.0.10

- Fix REST connector dynamic-property key for custom request headers (`requestHeaders`)

## 1.0.9

- Document Event Streams dead-letter queue (DLQ)


## 1.0.8

- Add Database (Legacy) profile (`profile.db`) coverage to the Document Cache component reference.


## 1.0.7

- Add Database (Legacy) connector references: connection, operation, database profile, and step


## 1.0.6

- Added support for reusable Map Script components that a map can reference instead of an inline script, and when to use each.
- Fixed a defect in the component-creation script that could blank a component's reference to another component on create.


## 1.0.5

- Strengthen instructions to avoid mapping the output of one function into the input of another
- Add componentId to map component sample snippets


## 1.0.4

- Add Flow Control step reference (`flow_control_step.md`) to the `boomi-integration` skill, covering batching, parallel fiber execution, scope-of-effect, document ordering across fibers, and state sharing between fibers and the controlling execution.
- SKILL.md inventory updated to include `flow_control_step.md`.
- BOOMI_THINKING.md gains a "Flow Control Steps" subsection under Step Design Principles with point-in-process scope guidance.


## 1.0.3

- Add `boomi-extensions.sh` for Environment Extensions value management: partial-by-default writes, pre-write snapshots, and more clear requirements for the model.
- Sharpen the Process Extensions reference.

## 1.0.2

- Boomi Companion now identifies the originating skill in its Boomi Platform API requests and local activity log entries.
- Document VERSION-file ownership in the plugin and skill `CLAUDE.md`.


## 1.0.1

- Add Mail (IMAP) connector reference to the `boomi-integration` skill: `mail_imap_connection_component.md` (SMTP outbound + IMAP inbound, Basic Auth and OAuth 2.0 with optional `OAUTH2_SAME_AS_OUTBOUND` inbound reuse), `mail_imap_connector_operation_component.md` (Receive / Send / Move with Document Cache attachment routing, XML request profile for Move, full `connector.mailsdk.*` property catalog), and `mail_imap_connector_step.md` (canvas XML for all three actions plus the Receive-as-start-step listener pattern). All behavioral claims runtime-validated against the Boomi platform.
- `document_cache_component.md` clarifies that the `DocumentPropertyKeyConfig.propertyId` field accepts connector-namespace properties (e.g. `connector.mailsdk.messageId`), useful for keying attachment caches off auto-tracked connector properties.
- SKILL.md inventory and common-workflow combinations updated to include the three new Mail (IMAP) reference files.


## 1.0.0

- **1.0.0** Boomi Companion debuts at Boomi World 2026.  Huzzah and rejoice!


## 0.6.7

- Final pre-release pass on the boomi-integration BOOMI_THINKING.md for accuracy and readability.


## 0.6.6

- Final pre-release pass on the boomi-integration SKILL.md for accuracy and readability.


## 0.6.5

- Emphasize in the boomi-integration CLI reference that `boomi-component-search.sh --related-to` cannot be combined with `--folder`, `--name`, or `--type`.


## 0.6.4

- `/freshies` no longer initializes a git repo automatically — the generated workspace is just the copied files, and users may add `.git` to their workspace as desired. Note: existing `/freshies` commands are unaltered; re-run `/bc-integration:configure-template-workspace` to apply the updates.
- Tightened `/bc-integration:configure-template-workspace` setup: Step 2 now uses a clear checklist (load the `boomi-integration` skill, derive the plugin root from its base directory, append `/template`, verify with `ls`) instead of a multi-tier filesystem fallback. More deterministic, easier to follow.


## 0.6.3

- Tighten template CLAUDE.md instructions prior to Boomi World full launch. Note: These template updates are not applied automatically to existing template workspaces. Re-run /bc-integration:configure-template-workspace to merge these updates into an existing template workspace if desired.

## 0.6.2

- Reformatted `template/preferred_connections.md` markdown and expanded the example registry entries to demonstrate three distinct usage shapes. Note: existing User Template workspaces will not be auto-updated by this change. Re-run `/bc-integration:configure-template-workspace` to merge the updated `preferred_connections.md` into your User Template.

## 0.6.1

- Add Documentation section to plugin and skill READMEs linking to the Boomi Companion overview on the Boomi Developer Portal
- Add Related Plugins & Skills section to plugin and skill READMEs to surface sibling plugins and standalone skills in the Boomi Companion ecosystem


## 0.6.0

- Minor release: the `active-development/` workspace now uses Boomi component-type identifier folders (`process/`, `profile.json/`, `connector-action/`, etc.) instead of generic plural names. New component types are discovered automatically, but the convention shift affects where the assistant writes new components and how it treats legacy workspaces — significant enough to surface beyond a patch bump.
- Components now land in `active-development/<component-type>/` folders matching Boomi's platform identifier (e.g. `process/`, `profile.json/`, `connector-action/`). New component types are picked up automatically. The CLI reference adds a UI-label-to-identifier table for the non-obvious cases (Connection → `connector-settings`, Operation → `connector-action`, Map → `transform.map`).
- Document cache `profileType` enum corrected from the invalid `profile.database` to `profile.db`.
- SKILL.md notes the `mkdir -p active-development/<component-type>/` step needed before writing a new component from scratch (the pull path handles this automatically).
- Existing workspaces with the legacy plural folder names (`processes/`, `profiles/`, etc.) keep working as-is. When the assistant sees them, it raises the inconsistency and offers to migrate, rather than either silently extending the legacy layout or unilaterally renaming.


## 0.5.52

- Strengthen `<skill-path>` resolution guidance in SKILL.md with an explicit checklist (anchor → verify → reuse the same path on every call) to prevent path-segment drift between script invocations.
- Apply `<skill-path>` prefix to remaining bare `scripts/` references in `boomi_error_reference.md` and `platform_entities/shared_web_server.md`.


## 0.5.51

- Pipeline now supports explicit minor/major version bumps via reserved `changes/_minor.md` and `changes/_major.md` fragments; default behavior remains a patch bump


## 0.5.50

- Slim default `template/.claude/settings.json` to a minimum-viable allow-list. Fixes `tools/*` → `scripts/*`, scopes plugin reads to `bc-**`, hoists `outputStyle` to top level.
- Skill snippets now show `boomi-shared-server-info.sh` without `$BOOMI_TEST_ATOM_ID` (the preferred baseline behavior)— the script already defaults to that var, and the bare form avoids a `simple_expansion` approval prompt in Claude Code.
- Normalize `componentId=""` for CREATE in five component references (REST + custom-connector connection/operation, MCP connection/operation) so the agent stops reaching for `uuidgen` — the platform mints the GUID on POST.

## 0.5.49

- Document how Web Services Server listeners expose URL query parameters as `query_*` DPPs, including the read pattern (`valueType="process"` + `<processparameter>`).
- Call out the silent-failure anti-pattern of reading DPPs via `valueType="track"` (with `mime.X` or `process.X` propertyIds), which returns empty without error.


## 0.5.48

- Add `references/platform_entities/shared_web_server.md` documenting the full set of shared-web-server auth types (None, Basic, Client Certificate, Client Certificate Header, Custom, External Provider, Gateway), the per-port multi-mode model, and an empirically-validated description of what `SharedServerInformation` can and can't tell you about a runtime's listener auth (default port only; `auth` is omitted when the value falls outside the `none|basic` enum). Reframes prior assumption that Basic is universally required — Boomi public cloud is Basic-only, but local Runtimes and customer-owned Private Runtime Clouds are not. Establishes the user's `.env` declarations as authoritative; the API surface is supplementary.
- Replace `boomi-wss-test.sh`'s hard-coded Basic auth with an explicit `.env`-driven model: `SERVER_AUTH_TYPE` (`basic | bearer | none`) declares the scheme, with `SERVER_USERNAME` + `SERVER_TOKEN` for Basic and the new `SERVER_BEARER_TOKEN` for Bearer. Tokens stay in `.env` (and out of the agent's conversation context). Unset `SERVER_AUTH_TYPE` falls back to inference from populated credentials, with hard-fail on ambiguity (both schemes set, or only one of the two Basic vars).
- `boomi-shared-server-info.sh` now reports `auth` informatively (with an explicit "default port uses cert/custom/gateway/external-provider" line when the field is omitted by the API), annotates `url` and `minAuth` to clarify they describe the default port and the runtime-wide floor respectively, and no longer attempts a `SERVER_AUTH_TYPE`-vs-API cross-check (the API surface is structurally too thin to support reliable validation).
- Reframe `SERVER_*` references in `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `template/.env.example`, and `references/guides/user_onboarding_guide.md` around the new auth-type-declaring model.


## 0.5.47

- Update README feedback address from solutions@boomi.com to developer-offerings@boomi.com (plugin and boomi-integration skill)


## 0.5.46

- Activity logging is now opt-in: the boomi-integration CLI no longer writes `.activity-log/activity.jsonl` unless `BOOMI_COMPANION_LOG_ACTIVITY=1` is set in `.env`.
- `activity.jsonl` schema: rename `plugin_version` → `skill_version`.
- `boomi_api` accepts an optional `--out-file <path>` argument so callers can stream the response straight to a file. `boomi-component-pull.sh` and `boomi-execution-query.sh` now route through `boomi_api` instead of calling `boomi_curl` directly.


## 0.5.45

- Add HTTP Client awareness reference (`boomi-integration/references/components/http_client_component.md`) so the agent can safely work with existing HTTP Client connections, operations, and steps it encounters in customer environments
- `BOOMI_THINKING.md` continues to direct new work to the modern REST client; edits to existing `connectorType="http"` components now route through the new reference


## 0.5.44

- Add API Service Component (REST) reference covering component structure, per-route override inheritance, URL path construction, profile-override key correlation, and required placeholder elements for unused API shapes — the Integration-native deployable that wraps WSS Listen processes for Advanced-runtime deployment
- Add `boomi-shared-server-info.sh` preflight script that reports a runtime's `apiType`, `url`, and `minAuth` — run before authoring any listener to route `basic`/`intermediate` → bare WSS vs. `advanced` → API Service Component
- Document the silent-404 failure mode when listener pattern does not match runtime API tier: deployment succeeds but every route returns HTTP 404 at request time. Deploy API does not surface the mismatch
- Document that packaging/deploying an API Service Component does not cascade to the processes it references — both the component and each linked Listen process must be independently deployed to the target runtime, or routes 404 at request time
- Document URL path collision behavior: two API Service Components with the same effective URL on the same runtime both deploy `active=true`, but only the first-deployed serves. Shadowed routes are not registered at runtime; reclaiming the slot requires a fresh redeploy of the loser after undeploying the winner
- Clarify URL case-sensitivity split: bare `/ws/simple/` URLs sentence-case `objectName`; API Service Component routes are case-sensitive and verbatim
- Correct API management scope: the API Service Component itself is in-scope for this skill; gateway-level policies (rate limiting, subscription plans, developer portal, API Proxy) remain out-of-scope


## 0.5.43

- Remove incorrect `//` comment rule from Data Process Groovy step reference; clarify CDATA is a push-side convenience, not canonical storage
- Add Issue #30 to error reference: Groovy syntax errors deploy cleanly, surface only at runtime


## 0.5.42

- Add EDIFACT support across EDI reference docs: profile options, delimiter defaults, composite element patterns, tagList examples, trading partner PartnerInfo (UNB/UNG/UNH control info), envelope comparison, and connector record API fields
- Fold EDI config-critical facts into existing Boomi-mechanics docs — Transaction Set ID → GS-01 table and HIPAA GS-08 Implementation Convention reference in `edi_profile_component.md`; full UNOA–UNOY syntax identifier list and HIPAA compliance constraints in `trading_partner_component.md`; transaction pair dependencies and X12↔EDIFACT transaction-level equivalence in `platform_entities/edi_b2b.md` (reduces IP exposure vs. reproducing standards content standalone while keeping Boomi-configuration knowledge in place)
- Add Schema Validation Rules section to `edi_profile_component.md` covering HTTP 400 forbidden attributes (on EdiDelimitedOptions, EdiX12Options, EdiDataElement, EdiLoop, EdiSegment, DataFormat), DataFormat child element requirements, single-segment loop wrapping, HL hierarchy auto-generation pattern, and tagLists universal decision rule
- Add `references/guides/edi_sap_patterns.md` covering IDoc structure basics, EDI_DC40 control record fields, segment hierarchy and cardinality, Z-segment extension pattern, NAD party qualifier to SAP partner function (standard SD module codes: BY/AG, SE/LF, DP/WE, IV/RE), qualifier-driven routing and composite decomposition patterns, cross-reference table design categories, and validation patterns
- Reshuffle BOOMI_THINKING.md to move EDI Profile Design mental models (X12 and EDIFACT) out of top-level Core Mental Models into a dedicated section near the end of the file
- Update SKILL.md tree with `guides/edi_sap_patterns.md` entry and expanded `platform_entities/edi_b2b.md` description covering the new transaction pair and equivalence content


## 0.5.41

- Clarify that Disk V2 CREATE and UPSERT both require `connector.disk-sdk.fileName` to be set via a Set Properties step before the connector executes; point readers to `set_properties_step.md` for the shape structure and source-value types


## 0.5.40

- Add developer-offering disclaimer to `skills/boomi-integration/README.md` to match the plugin README


## 0.5.39

- Add disclaimer to README clarifying Boomi Companion is a publicly available developer offering, not an officially supported Boomi product


## 0.5.38

- Add `boomi-component-search.sh` — query components by folder, name, type, or reference relationship via `ComponentMetadata/query` and `ComponentReference/query`. Results land in `active-development/inventories/component_search_<timestamp>.json` (ephemeral alongside other working files). Folder scoping is flat; implicit filters `currentVersion=true` and `deleted=false` apply to component queries. Type filter accepts Boomi API-level types (e.g. `connector-settings` for a connection, `connector-action` for an operation) — runtime-validated against a real account.
- `boomi-component-search.sh --folder` now accepts id, exact name, or a LIKE pattern with `%` wildcards (e.g. `--folder 'Acme-%'`). Folder resolution paginates via `queryMore` so broad patterns aren't silently capped at the 100-result page size. Multiple matches are unioned via OR on `folderId`, and the resolved id list is surfaced in the output file's `metadata.filters.resolvedFolders`. Non-wildcard input preserves the previous behavior: id → exact-name → error on zero or ambiguous matches.
- `boomi-component-search.sh --related-to` now resolves the target component's current version up front and pins both `parentComponentId` and `parentVersion` on the `references` side of the query (components the target references). The `ComponentReference/query` endpoint rejects `parentComponentId` without its `parentVersion` companion, which made the previous flag DOA. Resolved version is surfaced in the output file's `metadata.filters.resolvedVersion`. Each output record carries a `relation` field of `"references"` or `"referenced-by"` to make direction explicit.
- `boomi-component-search.sh` pagination and final output assembly both stream through tempfiles and read back via `jq --slurpfile` instead of passing JSON via `jq --argjson`. Removes two separate `ARG_MAX` ceilings that previously truncated result sets past ~1-2k records with `jq: Argument list too long`; stress-tested at 5,000 records (2.6 MB output file).
- `boomi-component-search.sh` writes results atomically (`.tmp` + `mv`), with trap-based tempfile cleanup. Prevents the 0-byte orphan files that could appear in `active-development/inventories/` when the output-assembly `jq` failed mid-write.
- `boomi-component-search.sh` now emits `log_activity` entries on all failure paths (folder resolve, version resolve, query failure) with the failing stage tagged — previously only success paths were logged, which was asymmetric with sibling scripts like `boomi-undeploy.sh`.


## 0.5.37

- Add date subtypes (relative, last, lastsuccessful) to Set Properties reference with runtime-validated XML and behavioral notes
- Add legacy database connection requirement to sql and sp value types
- Add connector input filter attributes (elementToSetId, elementToSetName) and enforceSingleResult zero-result behavior

- Add `version_management_guide.md` — versioning model, history, retrieval, comparison, deletion behavior, branch interactions
- Add HTTP 403 (identical content) to problem solving guide

## 0.5.26

- Introduce `<skill-path>` convention for script paths — all documentation now uses `<skill-path>/scripts/` instead of bare `scripts/` to ensure correct path resolution when the skill is loaded as a plugin

## 0.5.25

- Update all installation references from `boomi-marketplace` to `boomi-companion`

## 0.5.24

## 0.5.22

- Add error reference Issue #29 (Component Locking) — documents that GUI-held locks block all API writes and cannot be queried or released via API

## 0.5.21

- Add `boomi-wss-test.sh` — wrapper for testing WSS listener endpoints (handles auth, SSL, content-type internally)
- Add WSS listener path collision probe to `boomi-deploy.sh` — warns when an endpoint is already occupied before deploying
- Streamline WSS testing docs in `process_testing_guide.md` — replace raw curl examples with script usage

## 0.5.17

- Add Document Cache component reference (`document_cache_component.md`) — component structure, attributes, CacheIndex/key type polymorphism (ProfileElementKeyConfig, DocumentPropertyKeyConfig, UserDefKeyConfig unsupported), non-zero ID requirements, profileType enforcement, map lookup constraints (DocumentCacheLookup vs DocumentCacheJoins)

- Add `valueType="current"` to Set Properties source value types (validated via runtime toggle test)
- Add subprocess execution visibility guidance to testing guide (parent logs contain subprocess output, no independent ExecutionRecord for parent-invoked subprocesses)
